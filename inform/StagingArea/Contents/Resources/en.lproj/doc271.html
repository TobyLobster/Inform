    <p class="sectionheading">§17.9. Understanding kinds of value</p>
    <p>In many cases, if K is the name of a kind of value, then Inform automatically makes an Understand token called &quot;[K]&quot; which matches only values of K. An example is &quot;[number]&quot;, which matches text like 203 or SEVEN. There is a chart of the kinds of value in the Kinds index for a project, showing which ones can be understood in this way.</p>
    <p>In particular, any newly created kind of value can always be understood. We make good use of that in the example story &quot;Studious&quot;:</p>

    <p>Note the way we can refer to the limb mentioned by the player as the &quot;limb understood&quot;. Similarly, we could talk about the &quot;number understood&quot; if the value parsed had been a number, and so on.</p>
    <p>One of the built-in kinds of value is worth special note: time. A time can hold either a specific time of day, such as 10:23 PM, or a duration of something, such as 21 minutes. The &quot;[a time]&quot; token matches times of day, such as 10:15 AM or MIDNIGHT. But 10 MINUTES wouldn't be recognised by &quot;[a time]&quot; since it isn't a specific moment in the day. To get around this, an alternative version called &quot;[a time period]&quot; is available. So:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c5758"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c5758"></a>Understand &quot;wait for [a time period]&quot; as ...
    </p>

    <p>would match WAIT FOR AN HOUR or WAIT FOR TWO HOURS 12 MINUTES.</p>

            <p>One approach would be to write many different understand rules and actions: one action for reading randomly, one for reading a specific page, one for reading the first page, one for reading the previous page, one for reading the next page, and one for reading the last page. But this gets tedious to construct and maintain.</p>
            <p>More usefully, we could consider that all of the last four options are essentially the same action at heart: the player is asking to read a page in the book using a name rather than a number, and we will have to perform a minor calculation to discover what the number should be.

            <p>Now and then in IF there is a situation where we need to ask the player for a numbered choice rather than an ordinary action command. What's more, that numbered choice might change during the game, so we don't want to just hard-wire the meanings of &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, and &quot;3&quot; whenever the player types them.</p>
            <p>A better trick is to keep a list or table (we'll use a table here because it involves slightly less overhead) recording what the player's numerical choices currently mean. Then every time the player selects a number, the table is consulted, and if the number corresponds to something, the player's choice is acted on.</p>
            <p>In our example, we'll have a transporter pad that can take the player to any room in the game that he's already visited. (Just for the sake of example, we'll start him off with a few pre-visited rooms.)</p>
