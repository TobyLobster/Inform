    <p>Lastly we can also ask for a more specific number of possibilities, like so:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c1263"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c1263"></a>if two women are carrying animals
    <br>
    if at most three doors are open
    <br>
    if fewer than 10 portable containers are closed
    <br>
    if all but two of the devices are switched on
    <br>
    if there are more than six locked doors
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Likewise for &quot;less than&quot;, &quot;at least&quot;, &quot;all except&quot;. Something to watch out for is that</p>
    <!--START CODE "c1264"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c1264"></a>if two doors are open
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>will be found true if there are (say) three open doors: after all, if three doors are open, then certainly two doors are. So this is not quite counting. We can be more precise by writing</p>
    <!--START CODE "c1265"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c1265"></a>if exactly two doors are open
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>The &quot;all but&quot; counts - say, &quot;if all but two doors are open&quot; - are exact: if, in fact, all of the doors are open then this will be found false.</p>
    <p>We can often use these counting forms with values, too. As with the use of &quot;all&quot;, this is allowed only if the kind of value is one which can reasonably be searched through. For example:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c1266"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c1266"></a>if more than three scenes are happening
    <br>
    if there are more than two non-recurring scenes
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>are allowed because the built-in kind of value &quot;scene&quot; (of which much more later on) has only a small number of possible values.</p>
    <p>Lastly, note that the &quot;the&quot; in text like &quot;two of the doors&quot; matters: without it, the phrase will not be recognised as a requirement on the number. (This is to make sure that names of things like &quot;two of hearts&quot; are not misinterpreted.)</p>
