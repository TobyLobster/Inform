    <p class="sectionheading">§17.10. Commands consisting only of nouns</p>
    <p>In every example so far, and in almost all practical cases, the first word in a command which results in an action will be something fixed: a verb, in fact. When we write</p>
    <!--START CODE "c5814"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c5814"></a>Understand &quot;photograph [something]&quot; as photographing.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>we are saying that the first word of such a command will always be &quot;photograph&quot;. Occasionally, though, we would like to understand a noun as a command, perhaps in a situation where the command is obvious. If we say:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c5815"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c5815"></a>Understand &quot;[something]&quot; as examining.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>then the command &quot;examine&quot; will be implicit when the player types a bare noun:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c5816"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c5816"></a>A red box and a blue ball are here.
    <br>
    &gt; BALL
    <br>
    The blue ball is plaited from many small leather patches.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>so that the command &quot;ball&quot; has resulted in the action &quot;examining the blue ball&quot;.</p>
    <p>This is a feature which should be used sparingly, since it could easily lead to confusion if not carefully explained to the player. By default, it is not used at all.</p>
    <p>It also has what may be a serious limitation: verbless commands like this work only when typed by the player as actions to follow - they do not work as instructions for other people. So for instance SVEN, BALL would not ask Sven to try examining the ball - instead it would generate the action &quot;answering ball to Sven&quot;. (This is because the Inform parser decides whether PERSON, SOME TEXT is a request or just conversation by looking at the first word after the comma to see if it's a command.)</p>

            <p>The foregoing example moves the player one location towards his destination, and requires that rooms have been visited before. But suppose we wanted to be a bit more lenient about movement, and let the player make as many steps as necessary per turn. We will also show consideration about doors, using the &quot;Locksmith&quot; extension supplied with Inform. (Now every time the code attempts opening a door, unlocking rules will also be invoked.)</p>
