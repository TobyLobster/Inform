    <p>We come at last to the final thing which can be specified about an action, and appropriately enough it must be specified with the final words of the description. This is the way to talk about repeated activity:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c1608"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c1608"></a>Instead of examining the tapestry for the third time, say &quot;All right, so it's a masterpiece, but is this really the time to make a detailed study?&quot;
    </p>
    </blockquote>

    <!--START CODE "c1609"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c1609"></a>Instead of examining the urn at least twice, say &quot;It's an urn. What do you want from me?&quot;

    <!--START CODE "c1610"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c1610"></a>Instead of going nowhere for the 20th time, say &quot;Do stop walking into walls, there's a good fellow.&quot;
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Note that we are allowed to spell out numbers up to twelve in English words, but beyond that must use digits (thus &quot;twelfth&quot; is allowed but not &quot;thirteenth&quot;: &quot;13th&quot; should be used instead). The following example is instructive:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c1611"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c1611"></a>Instead of taking something for the fourth time, say &quot;No. I'm capricious.&quot;
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>This means that it is the fourth time a &quot;taking...&quot; action has been tried, and does not mean that the same item was taken each time. Also, note that we are counting the number of times the action has been tried, not the number of times it succeeded.</p>

There are probably more sophisticated diagnostics, but as a first cut, let's assume that a player who repeatedly reviews descriptions of objects they've already seen, looks around the room, and takes inventory, is at a loss for more productive activities.

            <p>The following is an almost-completely-faithful rewrite of Emily Short's &quot;A Day for Fresh Sushi&quot;, which was originally written using the (very different) Inform 6 programming language. The -- let us be honest and call it a gimmick -- of this game is the evil fish, who has some unpleasant remark to offer on pretty much every action. But the effect would wear off fast if he repeated himself, so these comments need to be single-use only.</p>
            <p>Inform 7's repeated action syntax makes it much tidier to write the same scenario, so:</p>

You only met the old woman once, before she faded out of existence in a little hospice in Salzburg.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]In the picture, her hands are grasping tightly at a small grey bottle, the pills to which she became addicted in her old age, and strange, gargoyle-like forms clutch at her arms and whisper in her ears.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]But the disturbing thing, the truly awful thing, is the small figure of Britney herself, down in the corner, unmistakable: she is walking away. Her back turned.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]You thought she[=0x0027=]d finally talked this out, but evidently not. Still feels guilty for leaving. You only barely stop yourself from tracing, with your finger, those tiny slumped shoulders...[=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Instead of taking the painting, say [=0x0022=]No, you[=0x0027=]d better leave it.

At the moment, the glass is thrown open, and a light breeze is blowing through.[otherwise]Through the windows, you get a lovely view of the street outside -- the little fountain on the corner, the slightly dilapidated but nonetheless magnificent Jugendstil architecture of the facing building. The glass itself is shut, however.[end if][=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]After opening the window for the first time:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=][=0x0027=]Thank god some air,[=0x0027=] says the fish. [=0x0027=]Man, it was getting hard to breathe in here.[=0x0027=] Two beats pass. [=0x0027=]Oh wait.[=0x0027=][=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]The table is scenery in the Studio. On the table is a vase. The vase is an open container. It is not openable.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]The description of the table is [=0x0022=]A monstrosity of poor taste and bad design: made of some heavy, French-empire sort of wood, with a single pillar for a central leg, carved in the image of Poseidon surrounded by nymphs. It[=0x0027=]s all scaley, and whenever you sit down, the trident has a tendency to stab you in the knee. But Britney assures you it[=0x0027=]s worth a fortune.[=0x0022=] The description of the vase is [=0x0022=]A huge vase -- what you saw once described in a Regency romance as an epergne, maybe -- something so big that it would block someone sitting at the table from seeing anyone else also sitting at the table. But it does function nicely as a receptacle for hugeass bouquets of flowers.[=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Instead of looking under the table for the first time:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=][=0x0027=]You[=0x0027=]re not going to find anything down there,[=0x0027=] whines the fish.
