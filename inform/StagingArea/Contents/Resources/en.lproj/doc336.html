    <p class="sectionheading">§19.12. Named outcomes</p>
    <p>We have seen that the terms &quot;success&quot; and &quot;failure&quot; can be misleading - after all, it might be a good thing for a particular rulebook to &quot;fail&quot;. At any rate, these are vague terms, and we don't want to have to remember the conventions used by every rulebook. This is why certain rulebooks have explicitly named outcomes instead. For instance, the &quot;visibility&quot; rules are allowed to have the outcomes:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c7916"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c7916"></a>there is sufficient light;
    <br>
    there is insufficient light;
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>These look like phrases, but are in fact named outcomes which can only be used in visibility rules. (They would make no sense elsewhere, and Inform will not allow their use if they are clearly out of context.) Such named outcomes are listed in the Rules index.</p>
    <p>There can be any number of named outcomes. For instance, the Standard Rules define:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c7917"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c7917"></a>The does the player mean rules are a rulebook. The does the player mean rules have outcomes it is very likely, it is likely, it is possible, it is unlikely and it is very unlikely.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>which makes five possible outcomes. Five outcomes seems to contradict the principle that there are only three possible outcomes for a rule: in fact, though, the five are counted as five different forms of &quot;success&quot;, and any of them will cause a &quot;does the player mean&quot; rule to succeed. If we do not want this, we can instead specify explicitly how the named outcomes correspond to success, failure or &quot;no outcome&quot;:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c7918"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c7918"></a>Visibility rules have outcomes there is sufficient light (failure) and there is insufficient light (success).
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Again, see the Rules index for examples.</p>
    <p>The same named outcome can be used for more than one rulebook, and can have different meanings in the context of different rulebooks - &quot;good news&quot; could be defined as success in one rulebook and failure in another, for instance. (This means that rulebook creators need not worry about name clashes and is an important difference in behaviour between rulebook outcomes and kinds of value.) We can even name a specific named outcome as the default outcome for rules in this rulebook:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c7919"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c7919"></a>Audibility rules have outcomes high background noise (failure), low background noise (success - the default) and absolute silence (success).
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>After a rulebook using named outcomes has run, we can test which outcome occurred by using the phrase:</p>
        <!--START PHRASE "defn281"-->
        <div class="definition">
            <a id="defn281"></a><p class='defnprototype'><b>outcome of the rulebook ... rulebook outcome</b></p>

            <!--END PHRASE-->
            <!--definition of ph_rulebookoutcome-->

    <p>    This phrase produces the (named) outcome of the phrase most recently followed. Example:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c7920"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c7920"></a>follow the audibility rules;
    <br>
    if the outcome of the rulebook is the absolute silence outcome:
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;You could hear a pin drop in here.&quot;
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->

        <!--end definition-->
    </div>

    <p>Each named outcome is a value if followed by the word &quot;outcome&quot;, which is how &quot;absolute silence&quot; has become &quot;the absolute silence outcome&quot;. Named outcomes can be said, so we could use the text substitution &quot;[outcome of the rulebook]&quot;, for instance. A final caveat: it is perfectly legal to create a named outcome which means &quot;no outcome&quot;, but if so then this will never be &quot;the outcome of the rulebook&quot; because &quot;no outcome&quot; is not an outcome.</p>

            <p>Let's say that we're implementing a particularly irrational and volatile character. Some of the time she remains composed; some of the time she reacts with unexpected vehemence for reasons only partly related to what was said.</p>
            <p>Moreover, her responses are divided between successful and failing outcomes, where success indicates that she's not too upset and failure means that she is distraught; we use this to determine how the rest of the room reacts.</p>
