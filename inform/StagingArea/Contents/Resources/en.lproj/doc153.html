    <p class="sectionheading">§10.4. During scenes</p>
    <p>Scenes are not only useful for changing the setting, by moving items or people around and providing a little narration. We can also make the rules different in one scene from another. For instance, at a sleepy country halt there is no reason why one should not walk across the tracks: but if there is a train in the way, that would be impossible.</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2422"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2422"></a>Before going north during the Train Stop, say &quot;The train blocks your way.&quot; instead.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Any rule can have the clause &quot;during ...&quot; attached, provided that clause goes at the end and either explicitly names a scene, or gives a description of which scenes would match. This is especially useful with &quot;every turn&quot;:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2423"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2423"></a>Every turn during the Train Stop, say &quot;Water is sluiced out of the tank and into the engine.&quot;
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>We can test whether a scene is happening with the adjective &quot;happening&quot;:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2424"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2424"></a>if Train Stop is happening, ...
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
        <!--START PHRASE "defn115"-->
        <div class="definition">
            <a id="defn115"></a><p class='defnprototype'><b>if </b>(scene)<b> has happened:</b></p>

            <!--END PHRASE-->
            <!--definition of ph_hashappened-->

    <p>    This condition is true if the given scene has both begun and ended.</p>

        <!--end definition-->
    </div>

        <!--START PHRASE "defn116"-->
        <div class="definition">

            <!--END PHRASE-->
            <!--definition of ph_hasnothappened-->

    <p>    This condition is true if the given scene has not ended (or never started).</p>

        <!--end definition-->
    </div>

        <!--START PHRASE "defn117"-->
        <div class="definition">
            <a id="defn117"></a><p class='defnprototype'><b>if </b>(scene)<b> has ended:</b></p>

            <!--END PHRASE-->
            <!--definition of ph_hasended-->

    <p>    This condition is true if the given scene ended at least once.</p>

        <!--end definition-->
    </div>

        <!--START PHRASE "defn118"-->
        <div class="definition">
            <a id="defn118"></a><p class='defnprototype'><b>if </b>(scene)<b> has not ended:</b></p>

            <!--END PHRASE-->
            <!--definition of ph_hasnotended-->

    <p>    This condition is true if the given scene has never ended.</p>

        <!--end definition-->
    </div>

    <p>We need to be a bit careful: it's possible to set things up so that the Train Stop scene will play out more than once, so &quot;Train Stop is happening&quot; and &quot;Train Stop has happened&quot; might both be true at once.</p>
    <p>The kind of value &quot;scene&quot; is one which is allowed to have properties - it has a tick in the &quot;properties&quot; column in the chart in the Kinds index - and this can be very useful in describing scenes. For instance, we could write:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2425"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2425"></a>A scene can be thrilling or dull. Train Stop is dull.
    <br>
    A scene has a text called cue speech. The cue speech of Train Stop is &quot;All aboard!&quot;.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Inform has the adjectives &quot;recurring&quot;, &quot;non-recurring&quot; and &quot;happening&quot; all built in to describe scenes, and the above would add &quot;thrilling&quot; and &quot;dull&quot;. Moreover, the &quot;during&quot; clause of a rule can give a description of a scene as easily as a specific scene name. For instance:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2426"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2426"></a>Before going north during a dull non-recurring scene, ...
    </p>

            <p>American radio adventure series of the 1950s were unobtrusively sponsored by breakfast cereals, as the following modest example demonstrates.

One way to set this up is to create a property for such scenes -- let's call them &quot;restricted&quot; -- and then write a rule that keeps the player in place while the scene happens:</p>

I will expect you to learn names. I will expect you to learn dates. I will expect you to study maps and I will expect you to produce evidence of exacting geographical knowledge on the exams. I will expect you to learn shapes of pottery and memorize masonry designs.

I will expect you to learn names. I will expect you to learn dates. I will expect you to study maps and I will expect you to produce evidence of exacting geographical knowledge on the exams.
