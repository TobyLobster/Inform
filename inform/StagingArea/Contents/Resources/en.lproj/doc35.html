    <p class="sectionheading">§3.12. Doors</p>
    <p>The map of an interactive fiction is the layout of rooms and the entrances and exits which connect them. So far, these map connections have always run from one room to another, like so:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c264"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c264"></a>The Painted Room is north of the Undertomb.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>However, we can also interpose doors between rooms, like so:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c265"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c265"></a>The heavy iron grating is east of the Orchard and west of the Undertomb. The grating is a door.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>The second sentence is needed since otherwise Inform will take &quot;heavy iron grating&quot; to be the name of a third room, whereas what we want is for the grating to be something physically present in both the Orchard and in the Undertomb, and acting as a conduit between them. To this end it needs to be a &quot;door&quot;, a kind we have not so far seen. In the absence of any other instruction, a newly created door will be fixed in place, closed and openable.</p>
    <p>The grating really does come in between the two rooms: the grating is what lies immediately east of the Orchard, not the Undertomb room. So if we wrote the following:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c266"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c266"></a>The Undertomb is east of the Orchard. The heavy iron grating is east of the Orchard and west of the Undertomb. The grating is a door.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>then Inform would say that this is a contradiction: we said the Undertomb was east of the Orchard, but then we said that the grating was east of the Orchard.</p>
    <p>Inform's &quot;door&quot; kind can be used for all manner of conduits, so the word door need not be taken literally. In Ursula K. Le Guin's beguiling novel &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot;, from which the above rooms are stolen, it is not a grating which interposes, but: </p>
    <!--START CODE "c267"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c267"></a>The red rock stair is east of the Orchard and above the Undertomb. The stair is an open door. The stair is not openable.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>In real life, most doors are two-sided, and can be used from either of the rooms which they join, but this is not always convenient for interactive fiction. Here is a one-sided door:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c268"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c268"></a>The blue door is a door. It is south of Notting Hill. Through it is the Flat Landing.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>(Note the use of &quot;it&quot; here as an optional abbreviation.) This will make a door visible only on the Notting Hill side; no map connection will be made in the reverse direction, unless we ask for one.</p>
    <p>So much for creating and describing individual doors. Once we need to write about doors in general, we are likely to want a way to find out where a given door sits in the map. The following phrases reveal this:</p>
        <!--START PHRASE "defn0"-->
        <div class="definition">
            <a id="defn0"></a><p class='defnprototype'><b>front side of </b>(object)<b> ... room</b></p>

            <!--END PHRASE-->
            <!--definition of ph_frontside-->

    <p>    This phrase produces the first of the one or two rooms containing a door - first in the order given in the source text. Example: if</p>
    <!--START CODE "c269"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c269"></a>The red rock stair is east of the Orchard and above the Undertomb.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>then &quot;front side of the red rock stair&quot; produces the Orchard. For a one-sided door, this produces the only room containing the door.</p>

        <!--end definition-->
    </div>

        <!--START PHRASE "defn1"-->
        <div class="definition">
            <a id="defn1"></a><p class='defnprototype'><b>back side of </b>(object)<b> ... room</b></p>

            <!--END PHRASE-->
            <!--definition of ph_backside-->

    <p>    This phrase produces the last of the one or two rooms containing a door - last in the order given in the source text. Example: if</p>
    <!--START CODE "c270"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c270"></a>The red rock stair is east of the Orchard and above the Undertomb.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>then &quot;back side of the red rock stair&quot; produces the Undertomb. A one-sided door has no &quot;back side.&quot;</p>

        <!--end definition-->
    </div>

    <p>More often, we are dealing with a door and want to know what it leads to, but that depends where we're standing:</p>
        <!--START PHRASE "defn2"-->
        <div class="definition">
            <a id="defn2"></a><p class='defnprototype'><b>other side of </b>(door)<b> from </b>(room)<b> ... object</b></p>

            <!--END PHRASE-->
            <!--definition of ph_othersideof-->

    <p>    This phrase produces the room on the other side of the door, as seen from the given vantage point, which needs to be one of its sides. Example: if</p>
    <!--START CODE "c271"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c271"></a>The red rock stair is east of the Orchard and above the Undertomb.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>then &quot;other side of the red rock stair from the Undertomb&quot; produces the Orchard, and vice versa.</p>

        <!--end definition-->
    </div>

        <!--START PHRASE "defn3"-->
        <div class="definition">
            <a id="defn3"></a><p class='defnprototype'><b>direction of </b>(door)<b> from </b>(room)<b> ... object</b></p>

            <!--END PHRASE-->
            <!--definition of ph_directionofdoor-->

    <p>    This phrase produces the direction in which the door leads, as seen from the given vantage point, which needs to be one of its sides. Example: if</p>
    <!--START CODE "c272"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c272"></a>The red rock stair is east of the Orchard and above the Undertomb.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>then &quot;direction of the red rock stair from the Undertomb&quot; produces up.</p>

            <p>Suppose we want to offer the player a window they can climb through, instead of a boring ordinary door. Our window will be like a door in that it connects two rooms, appears in both places, and impedes movement when it is shut.

            <p>Now we have a &quot;bedroom window&quot; object which can be entered. Now, to catch the case where the player types &quot;LOOK THROUGH WINDOW&quot;:</p>

            <p>The other side of a door is always defined to be the room that we are not currently in when doing the check. When we are in the bedrooom, the other side will be the grassy slope, and vice versa. &quot;Searching&quot; is the action that occurs when the player attempts to LOOK THROUGH something. (To review what grammar gives rise to what actions, we can always consult the Actions portion of the Index.)</p>
            <p>Next we want to cover the case where we climb through the window:</p>

            <!--END CODE-->
            <p>And because &quot;climb window&quot; is understood but &quot;climb THROUGH window&quot; is not, we will have to borrow from the chapter on Understanding to add some new vocabulary to the game (and we'll add Jump too, while we're at it):</p>

            <p>Now the final piece: Inform will already keep the player from going through a closed window, but it will say &quot;You can't, since the bedroom window is in the way.&quot; This is probably not ideal, so we can replace the instruction thus:</p>
