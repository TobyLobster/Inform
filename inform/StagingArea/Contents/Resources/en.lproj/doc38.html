    <p class="sectionheading">§3.13. Locks and keys</p>
    <p>It seems unwise for a door in Notting Hill to be unlocked, so:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c291"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c291"></a>The blue door is lockable and locked. The matching key of the blue door is the brass Yale key.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Since the second sentence here is a little clumsy, we can equivalently say</p>
    <!--START CODE "c292"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c292"></a>The brass Yale key unlocks the blue door.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Yet a third way to say this is:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c293"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c293"></a>The blue door has matching key the brass Yale key.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>This introduces three new properties: a door can be locked or unlocked; lockable or not lockable; and it can have a matching key, which must be another thing. The same thing can be the matching key of many different locks: and note that a door can be locked and even lockable without having a matching key at all, in which case the player trying to open it will be permanently out of luck. Doors are ordinarily unlocked, not lockable, and without a matching key.</p>
    <p>Containers can also have locks, in exactly the same way, and are allowed to have the same properties. On the other hand supporters never have locks: it makes no sense to be able to lock a tabletop, for instance, and Inform will not allow any discussion of the matching key of a supporter, or of a supporter being locked or unlocked.</p>

            <p>Now there's a silver key that will unlock it -- though since we haven't said where the key is, the player will never be able to find it in the game. (If we look at the World index, we find &quot;small silver key&quot; right at the bottom, not inside any of the rooms. That is as good as not existing at all -- though we usually use the term &quot;out of play&quot; -- but as we will later see, it is possible to have things initially out of play but brought into existence later on.)</p>

            <p>The next part is going to require that we modify the normal operation of the &quot;lock&quot; command. &quot;Lock&quot; ordinarily requires that the player supply two objects: a thing he wants to unlock, and the key he wants to use on it. The full command is LOCK DOOR WITH THE KEY, and Inform will not accept simply LOCK DOOR as locking.</p>
            <p>Therefore, we're going to need to create our own new variant on the lock verb (and the unlock verb, while we're at it). The full procedure for this is laid out in the chapters on Action and Understanding, but here is an example:</p>

            </blockquote>
            <!--END CODE-->
            <p>Here we've created a new action -- locking something without a key -- and we've told Inform to understand LOCK DOOR as this action, rather than an incomplete command to LOCK DOOR WITH SOMETHING.</p>
            <p>Now we add some instructions so that the game will not let us use this keyless unlocking command unless we're in the right place or are properly equipped:</p>

            <br>
            &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the noun is locked, say &quot;[The noun] is already locked.&quot; instead;
            <br>
            &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the player carries the brass key and the player is in the Stairwell, try locking the noun with the brass key instead;
            <br>
            &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the player is in the Stairwell, say &quot;You can't lock the door from this side without the key.&quot; instead.
            </p>
            </blockquote>
            <!--END CODE-->
            <p>This check rule is performed before the keyless locking action succeeds. The first thing we do is try to use the key if the player is outside and has the key: this way, LOCK DOOR will turn automatically into LOCK DOOR WITH THE KEY, under circumstances where that is both possible and necessary.</p>
            <p>The second thing is to check whether the player is outside but keyless, and, if so stop the action from being performed successfully. Here we print a failure message followed by the word &quot;instead&quot;, which tells Inform that we've substituted some other outcome for the usual performance of the action.</p>
            <p>Now we're reasonably sure that the player is only locking keylessly in the case that he is inside the Studio. (We might have to do a more thorough check for this if there were more than two rooms, but as it is, the player can only be in the Stairwell or in the Studio, so if we have ruled out the Stairwell, we are safe.) So now we want to add what happens when locking-without-a-key command succeeds:</p>
