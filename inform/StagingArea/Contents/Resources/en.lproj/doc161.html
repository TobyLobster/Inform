    <p class="sectionheading">§11.5. Conditions and questions</p>
    <p>A variety of &quot;conditions&quot; have already appeared in this documentation. A condition is a phrase which describes a situation which might be true, or might be false, and examples might include:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2866"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2866"></a>Mr Kite is in Bishopsgate
    <br>
    the score is greater than 10
    <br>
    Sherlock Holmes suspects a woman
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>These are all examples of sentences, formed by putting nouns either side of a verb, and clearly a wide range of conditions can be written this way. But there are also a few special conditions built into Inform which have a fixed wording, and test questions difficult to address with ordinary sentences. For instance:</p>
        <!--START PHRASE "defn121"-->
        <div class="definition">
            <a id="defn121"></a><p class='defnprototype'><b>if in darkness:</b></p>

            <!--END PHRASE-->
            <!--definition of ph_indarkness-->

    <p>    This condition is true if the player currently has no light to see by. Note that the test is more complicated than simply testing</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2867"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2867"></a>if the player is in a dark room, ...
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>since the player might have a torch, or be inside a cage which is itself in a dark room, and so on.</p>

        <!--end definition-->
    </div>

    <p>Another example of a condition not easily written as a sentence is:</p>
        <!--START PHRASE "defn122"-->
        <div class="definition">
            <a id="defn122"></a><p class='defnprototype'><b>if player consents:</b></p>

            <!--END PHRASE-->
            <!--definition of ph_consents-->

    <p>    This condition is unusual in doing something and not simply making a silent check: it waits for the player to type YES (or Y) or NO (or N) at the keyboard, and then is true if the answer was yes. Example:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2868"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2868"></a>say &quot;Are you quite sure you want to kiss the Queen? &quot;;
    <br>
    if the player consents:
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;...
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->

        <!--end definition-->
    </div>

    <p>Whether it's put to the player like this or not, testing a condition is really asking a question, and there is always a yes/no answer. In Inform this answer is not usually a value (unlike in some other computer programming languages), but it can be made into one.</p>
    <p>Firstly, we need a special kind of value to hold answers like this. It's called &quot;truth state&quot;, and it has just two possible values, written as &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;. We then need:</p>
        <!--START PHRASE "defn123"-->
        <div class="definition">
            <a id="defn123"></a><p class='defnprototype'><b>whether or not </b>(a condition)<b> ... truth state</b></p>

            <!--END PHRASE-->
            <!--definition of ph_whether-->

    <p>    This phrase converts a condition into its result as a value, which is always either &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. Example:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2869"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2869"></a>whether or not 20 is an odd number
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>produces the truth state &quot;false&quot;. This is mostly useful for storing up results to look at later:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2870"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2870"></a>let victory be whether or not all the treasures are in the cabinet;
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>and then subsequently:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2871"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2871"></a>if victory is true, ...
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->

        <!--end definition-->
    </div>

    <p>As another example, in most stories this:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2872"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2872"></a>When play begins:
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;showme whether or not in darkness.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>...will produce a line:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2873"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2873"></a>&quot;whether or not in darkness&quot; = truth state: false
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>In short, &quot;truth state&quot; is a kind of value like any other. That means it can be the kind of a variable:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2874"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2874"></a>Salvation earned is a truth state that varies.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>and it can similarly be used in table columns, lists, or anywhere else where values are allowed.</p>
