            <p>In this scenario, the player starts with a bag full of unsorted letters. These can be polite or rude, but he won't know which until he has examined them. What's more, he is allowed to sort the letters, in which case a group of letters will be shown as (for instance) &quot;two polite letters&quot;; but a group of mixed letters, even if they have all been read, will be called &quot;unsorted letters&quot;.</p>
            <p>Further, the player should be allowed to refer to sorted letters by tone, but not unsorted letters.</p>
            <p>To do this, we'll need printing the name... and printing the plural name..., as well as some special understanding rules.</p>
