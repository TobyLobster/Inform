    <p class="sectionheading">§9.13. The past and perfect tenses</p>
    <p>The remaining sections of this chapter go into more technical ways to think about the progress of the story through time, and can be skipped at a first reading.</p>
    <p>Conditions are clauses which require Inform to make a decision: is such-and-such true, or not true? We have already seen conditions attached to rules using &quot;when&quot;:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2299"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2299"></a>Instead of waiting when the Sorting Hat is in the Hall: ...
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>and, as we shall later see, we will often want to write instructions like:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2300"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2300"></a>if the Sorting Hat is in the Hall, say &quot;Hermione blinks apprehensively.&quot;
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>The condition is &quot;the Sorting Hat is in the Hall&quot;, and during play this will sometimes be true and sometimes false.</p>
    <p>A condition in the form &quot;X is Y&quot; is of course written in the present tense, and refers to the current state of affairs. Three other tenses are allowed. First, the present perfect:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2301"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2301"></a>if X has been Y ...
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>is true if it has ever been the case that &quot;X is Y&quot; at the start of any turn (or any action). So, for instance,</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2302"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2302"></a>if the gate has been open ...
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>will be valid if and only if the gate has ever been made open by any action (even if it is closed now), or if it started out by being open when play began.</p>
    <p>Next is the past tense:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2303"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2303"></a>if X was Y ...
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>holds if and only if &quot;X is Y&quot; was true at the start of the most recent action. This is convenient when trying to describe what has changed in the course of the action, but sometimes also when making the action itself happen. For instance:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2304"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2304"></a>if the lantern was switched on, now the lantern is switched off;
    <br>
    if the lantern was switched off, now the lantern is switched on;
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Completing the set is the past perfect:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2305"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2305"></a>if X had been Y ...
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>which records whether &quot;X has been Y&quot; was true at the start of the most recent action. All these verbs can of course be negated (though &quot;wasn't&quot; and &quot;hadn't&quot; are disallowed as poor style: we use &quot;was not&quot; and &quot;had not&quot; instead). So for example,</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2306"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2306"></a>if the player had not been in the Ballroom ...
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>is true if the player hadn't visited the Ballroom at the start of the most recent action.</p>
    <p>Something we must watch out for is that variables might not have the same values in the past that they have now. As a result, writing conditions such as &quot;if the noun has been open&quot; is a bad idea, because in the past &quot;the noun&quot; very likely referred to something different. It is really only safe to talk in the past tense about definite, fixed things: &quot;if the Great Gates of Kiev have been open&quot; would be fine.</p>

            <p>This is in many respects similar to a rule beginning &quot;After taking the mysterious box for the first time...&quot;, but it is superior in most circumstances, for two reasons.</p>
            <p>First, it will respond correctly even if the player has somehow carried the box before without taking it explicitly: for instance, if another character gave him the box, if the box were moved into his inventory as a result of another action, or if the player carried the box at the start of play. Inform begins its reckoning of time when the game begins, so if the box is defined as being open at the outset, &quot;if the box has been open&quot; will always be true.</p>
            <p>Second, &quot;after taking... for the first time&quot; fires only the first time the player attempts to take something. If the player tried to take the box, failed, and then tried again later, the &quot;for the first time...&quot; rule would not fire; our &quot;if the box has not been carried...&quot; rule would.</p>
