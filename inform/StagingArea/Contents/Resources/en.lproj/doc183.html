    <p class="sectionheading">§12.9. Check, carry out, report</p>
    <p>The normal behaviour of an action is specified by its three associated rulebooks - check, carry out and report. In the case of our &quot;photographing&quot; example, these rulebooks will be:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c3286"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3286"></a><span class="boldface">Check photographing</span>. Here, for instance, we need to verify that the player has the camera. If any of our checks fail, we should say why and stop the action. If they succeed, we say nothing.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <!--START CODE "c3287"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3287"></a><span class="boldface">Carry out photographing</span>. At this stage no further checking is needed (or allowed): the action now definitively takes place. At this point we might, for instance, deduct one from the number of exposures left on the film in the camera, or award the player points for capturing something interesting for posterity. But we should say nothing.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <!--START CODE "c3288"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3288"></a><span class="boldface">Report photographing</span>. At this stage no further activity is needed (or allowed): whatever effect the action had, it has happened and is now over. All we can do is to say what has taken place.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>So far we have not really gone into the business of what rulebooks are, and we don't do so here either - suffice to say that we can now create whatever rules we need:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c3289"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3289"></a>A check photographing rule:
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the camera is not carried:
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;You can hardly photograph without a camera, now can you?&quot; instead.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>In fact, writing &quot;a check photographing rule&quot; is over-formal. We can more simply label our rules like so:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c3290"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3290"></a>Check photographing:
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if we have photographed the noun:
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;You've already snapped [the noun].&quot; instead.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <!--START CODE "c3291"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3291"></a>Report photographing: say &quot;Click!&quot;
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>For the sake of brevity, photography has no interesting consequence (no points to be won, no film to use up), so there are no carry out rules here. Note the way we used the word &quot;instead&quot; once again to stop actions in their tracks.</p>
    <p>We can continue to add rules at any point, and a classic thing that happens when testing a new work is that the designer realises there is a case which has not been thought of:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c3292"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3292"></a>Check photographing:
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the noun is the camera:
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;That would require some sort of contraption with mirrors.&quot; instead.

            <p>This will be explored more in subsequent examples, but one of the things we can do with carry out rules is extend the function of existing commands so that they do more, or have special effects in specific situations.

            <p>...and in a small game with few rules, there's not much reason to add an extra stage. The ability to modify the stages of action processing becomes useful when we have a fairly large game with sophisticated modeling and want to be sure that some kinds of message (such as the sanity-check) are always handled before other things that we might be doing at the before stage (such as generating implicit actions like opening doors before going through them).</p>

            <p>Suppose the current sequence of action handling is not quite enough for us: we'd also like to have a stage after reporting, where other characters can react to the player character's behavior after it has already happened and been reported on screen. Having such a stage is unlike using &quot;after&quot;, because after occurs before reports and prevents them from being printed. So, for instance, we could allow the player to do any of a range of different actions that make loud noises, and have a nervous bird that reacts to all of them by flying away afterward.</p>
            <p>To do this, we can add a new rule into the specific action-processing rules. (For a list of these, see the Rules index.) Moving rules around and adding new ones requires syntax that we will learn in the chapter on Rulebooks, but the present example is fairly straightforward:</p>
