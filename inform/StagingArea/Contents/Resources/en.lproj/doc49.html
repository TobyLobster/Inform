    <p class="sectionheading">§3.26. Directions</p>
    <p>&quot;Direction&quot; is a kind which is quite unlike most of those seen so far. While it has to do with the physical world, a direction does not exactly belong to it. One cannot find &quot;southeast&quot; sitting on a shelf. &quot;Direction&quot; is not a kind of thing, nor a kind of room: it is a kind in its own right.</p>
    <p>Every direction has an &quot;opposite&quot; property, which is always another direction. These occur in matched pairs. The opposite of north is south, just as the opposite of south is north. The opposite of southeast is northwest, the opposite of inside is outside, and so on. When Inform reads a sentence like...</p>
    <!--START CODE "c488"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c488"></a>Bangkok is south of Nakhon Sawan.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>...it assumes that the opposite map connection is probably also valid, so that</p>
    <!--START CODE "c489"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c489"></a>Nakhon Sawan is north of Bangkok.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>The chapter began with the twelve directions built into Inform:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c490"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c490"></a>north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, up, down, inside, outside
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>But the built-in set is not always appropriate. Sometimes this is too many; if we wanted to write about a Flatland, for instance, then up and down ought to go. But in practice it is better not to abolish them as directions but instead to forbid travelling in them. (See the Recipe Book for examples.)</p>
    <p>But away from our familiar Earth, the usual frame of reference loses its meaning. Terry Pratchett's &quot;Discworld&quot; comedies, set on a rotating disc, use the directions turnwise, widdershins, hubwards and rimwards. On board a Zeppelin airship, which constantly changes its course, the cockpit has no fixed compass bearing from the passenger cabin: it is not very naturally &quot;north&quot;. In zero gravity, there is no up or down. Mars does not have a magnetic core, so a compass doesn't work there.</p>
    <p>New directions must always be created in opposing pairs, and each <span class="boldface">must</span> be declared with a clear simple sentence of the form &quot;X is a direction.&quot; For instance:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c491"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c491"></a>Turnwise is a direction. The opposite of turnwise is widdershins.
    <br>
    Widdershins is a direction. The opposite of widdershins is turnwise.
    <br>
    Hubwards is a direction. The opposite of hubwards is rimwards.
    <br>
    Rimwards is a direction. The opposite of rimwards is hubwards.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>It is then possible to write, say, that:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c492"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c492"></a>Ankh-Morpork is hubwards of Lancre and turnwise from Borogravia.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Of course the Map page of the Index for the project normally draws a map based on compass bearings, so it will get a little befuddled by this. But the map drawn in the Index can be given hints to improve its legibility. More on this later, but for now note that</p>
    <!--START CODE "c493"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c493"></a>Index map with turnwise mapped as east.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>maps turnwise directions as if they were east, that is, pointing rightwards on the page. (This has no effect on the story file produced; it does not mean turnwise is simply a new name for east; it affects only the look of the Index map, which is only a convenience for the author in any case.)</p>
    <p>At one time, directions had to have shortish names (up to three words only), but that's no longer true:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c494"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c494"></a>Just the tiniest smidge off magnetic north is a direction. The opposite of
    <br>
    just the tiniest smidge off magnetic north is just the tiniest smidge
    <br>
    off magnetic south.
    <br>
    Just the tiniest smidge off magnetic south is a direction. The opposite of
    <br>
    just the tiniest smidge off magnetic south is just the tiniest smidge
    <br>
    off magnetic north.

            <p>Wargaming is an ancient pursuit, but its modern form began as a professional training exercise in 19th-century Prussian staff colleges; since at least as early as H. G. Wells's &quot;Little Wars&quot; (1913) it has been a hobby of &quot;boys from twelve years of age to one hundred and fifty and for that more intelligent sort of girl who likes boys' games and books.&quot; The free-form tabletop game used miniature figures and tape-measured movements, and remains the dominant form today. But in the mid-20th century, map grids on printed sheets gave the hobby a sudden new lease of life. They were easier to set up, more interesting to look at, cheaper to sell by mail-order. 1970s sales figures for &quot;Strategy and Tactics&quot;, the leading US subscription-based wargame distributor, were very similar to those of Infocom's IF games in the 1980s. And like classical IF, the grid-based wargame parceled up a continuous world into locations.</p>
            <p>Grids were initially square, as on a chessboard, but square cells have several disadvantages. Four directions of movement (N, E, S, W) is too few, yet allowing movement in the diagonal directions means allowing tanks to travel about 1.4 times faster northeast than they do north. Square grids also only conform cleanly to man-made landscape features such as buildings in one orientation, and they never fit hills well. (A compromise measure to fix this, cutting the squares into octagons to leave smaller diamond squares at corner intersections, has never caught on.)</p>
            <p><img alt="hexes.jpg" src="inform:/doc_images/hexes.jpg" /></p>
            <p>But following Charles S. Roberts's American Civil War designs for Avalon Hill of 1958-61 (notably &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; and the second edition of &quot;Gettysburg&quot;), a hexagonal grid became the new standard. Each hexagon is the same distance from the centre of all six of its neighbours, which are at equal angular spacings; and clumps of hexagons fit the shape of lakes, contoured hills, and so forth, much more naturally than clumps of squares do. Hexes also have a certain mystique - an air of &quot;I don't belong in the children's department&quot;.</p>
            <p>But hexes are tricky for IF, not least because English lacks words for &quot;the direction 60 degrees around from front&quot;. Our cognitive view of the world tends to be square, perhaps because our two eyes both face front, in a direction at right angles to the plane of our arms, legs, pelvis and eyes. We reach out sideways at right angles to our walking. Even early hex-grid wargames called the cells &quot;squares&quot;, though &quot;hexes&quot; eventually caught on. Still and all:</p>

[paragraph break]What is kept here would not, on land, be dignified by the name of bread: it's hard tack, punishing to the teeth, dry on the tongue, and usually a home to weevils before half the journey is done.
