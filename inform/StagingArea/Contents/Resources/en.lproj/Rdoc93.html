    <p class="sectionheading">§11.3. Helping and Hinting</p>
    <p>IF is difficult to play: often harder than the writer ever suspects. Players are held up by what is &quot;obvious&quot;, and they stumble into unforeseen combinations, or spend inordinate amounts of time working on the &quot;wrong&quot; problems. Too much of this and they give up, or post questions on online forums. Against this, many IF authors like to include in-story hints.</p>
    <p>There are many approaches, which differ on two main issues.</p>
    <p>First: do we spontaneously offer help to the player? The difficulty here is detecting the player's need: <span class="boldface">Y ask Y?</span> tries to spot aimlessness, while <span class="boldface">Solitude</span> has a novice mode where it is reasonable to assume that help is almost always needed. On the other hand, suppose we require that the initiative come from the player. Will a novice know to type HELP? <span class="boldface">Query</span> shows how to redirect any attempt to ask a direct question into a HELP request. At the other end of the scale, wearily experienced players may type HELP all the time, out of habit, cheating themselves of the fun of frustration: if so, <span class="boldface">Real Adventurers Need No Help</span> provides the nicotine patch against this addiction.</p>
    <p>Second: how do we decide what help is needed? Normally the player only types HELP, which is unspecific. The simplest approach offers a menu, diagnosing the player's problem by obliging them to make choices: see <span class="boldface">Food Network Interactive</span>. Listing all the possible problems in the story may give away too much, though, since players may not have reached the puzzles in question yet; so some authors prefer to create menus that adapt to the current state of the story (commonly called &quot;adaptive hints&quot;).</p>
    <p>Failing this, we can also try to parse commands like HELP ABOUT MICRODOT, as in <span class="boldface">Ish.</span> <span class="boldface">Trieste</span> takes a similar tack, except that instead of offering hints about puzzles, it offers help on story features (such as how to save), and lists all the available topics if the player types simply HELP.</p>
    <p>Finally, and perhaps most stylishly, we can try to deduce what the player is stuck on from their immediate circumstances and from what is not yet solved: this needs a powerful adaptive hints system like the one in <span class="boldface">The Unexamined Life</span>.</p>

            <p>Suppose we'd like to watch for signs that the player is floundering, and if we see such signs, recommend that they try the hints. There are probably more sophisticated diagnostics, but as a first cut, let's assume that a player who repeatedly reviews descriptions of objects they've already seen, looks around the room, and takes inventory, is at a loss for more productive activities. So then...</p>

            <p>Observation of novice IF players suggests that they often have a hard time figuring out how to get started, especially if they are encountering the game in a context where they don't have time to settle in and read instructions.

            <p>This is divided into several parts. The first part is the system of rules for general guidance, which could be excerpted and used anywhere. The second part is a scenario using these rules.</p>

            <p>Hint systems in IF come in a variety of flavors: some are a static, prewritten set of guidelines (which might exist in a menu or outside the game entirely); others are built in as part of the program, and attempt to adapt to the situation the player currently faces. Adaptive hints have the advantage that they are less likely to reveal information for which the player is not ready, and the disadvantage that they are more work for the author.</p>
            <p>The exercise here is to write an adaptive hint system that will both respond in agile ways to the state of the world model and require a minimum of authorial fussing. We also want the player to be able to ask for a hint about any object they encounter in the game world: this will let them be specific and avoid accidentally receiving hints about the wrong puzzles.</p>
            <p>Our baseline assumption is that a player may find a puzzle unsolvable for one of two reasons: they either haven't seen the relevant clue, or they haven't got the relevant equipment. If these are true, then they should be given hints about how to find this information, and then once they have it, more specific hints about the puzzle itself -- ending, as a last resort, with the exact command(s) they will need to use in order to bring about the solution.</p>
            <p>In practice, there are other possibilities, but this will do for an example.</p>

            <p>That &quot;After printing...&quot; rule means that as soon as the game automatically prints the name of an object, it tags that object as having been &quot;seen&quot; by the player.
