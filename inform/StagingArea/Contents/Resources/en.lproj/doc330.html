    <p class="sectionheading">§19.4. Listing rules explicitly</p>
    <p>If rules can manage perfectly well without, why bother to have names for rules?</p>
    <p>The answer is that although Inform contains an elaborate mechanism for placing rules into the correct rulebook at the correct position, and this happens automatically, Inform will sometimes get it wrong. It will use a rule we do not want, or place them in an order which does not suit us. To put this right, we can give explicit instructions which take precedence over Inform's normal practice. This is done with the &quot;to list&quot; verb, as in the following examples.</p>
    <p>1. The simplest usage is to place a named rule, which currently has no home, in any rulebook of our choice. (This looks redundant, but just occasionally we want the same rule to appear in two different rulebooks.)</p>
    <!--START CODE "c7439"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c7439"></a>The blossom rule is listed in the every turn rules.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>A rule can appear in more than one rulebook, but within any single rulebook it can only appear once.</p>
    <p>2. We can also specify that the rule needs to appear before, or after, some other named rule in the same rulebook:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c7440"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c7440"></a>The collapsing bridge rule is listed before the moving doorways rule in the instead rules.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Instead of being placed in specificity order in the whole &quot;instead&quot; rulebook, the &quot;collapsing bridge&quot; rule would now be placed in specificity order only in the first half of the &quot;instead&quot; rulebook - the rules from the start up to (but not including) the &quot;moving doorways&quot; rule. To reiterate: that doesn't necessarily mean it will be immediately before the &quot;moving doorways&quot; rule; it will be placed according to Inform's usual sorting rules within that range.</p>
    <p>&quot;Listed&quot; sentences are obeyed by Inform in sequence, so if later ones issue instructions contradicting earlier ones, it's the later ones which win out. Thus if we say &quot;A is listed before B in X&quot; and then &quot;B is listed before A in X&quot;, the result is that B comes before A.</p>
    <p>3. We can specify that a rule needs to appear first or last in a given rulebook:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c7441"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c7441"></a>The collapsing bridge rule is listed first in the instead rules.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Again, if we make several such instructions about the same rulebook then the most recent one wins: &quot;A is listed first in X. B is listed first in X. C is listed first in X.&quot; causes rulebook X to begin C, B, A.</p>
    <p>4. We can also substitute one rule for another:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c7442"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c7442"></a>My darkness rule is listed instead of the can't act in the dark rule in the visibility rules.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>If rule A is listed instead of rule B in rulebook X, and A was already a rule in rulebook X, then A will move from its previous position to occupy the place where B was, and B will disappear. (In particular rule A will not be duplicated, which would break the principle that no rule occurs twice in the same rulebook.)</p>
    <p>5. And we can strike down existing rules, either specifically or in all their applications:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c7443"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c7443"></a>The can't act in the dark rule is not listed in the visibility rules.
    <br>
    The can't remove from people rule is not listed in any rulebook.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>This does not actually destroy the rules in question: they could still, for instance, be put into another rulebook, or even be applied explicitly, as we shall see. But unless we take deliberate action to the contrary, un-listing a rule amounts to abolishing it forever. This is a little drastic, and more subtle effects can be seen in the next section.</p>

            <p>Suppose that we want the player always to see full room descriptions, even if he tries to reset the defaults -- perhaps because there is vital information there which he will miss if he turns off full-length room descriptions.</p>
            <p>To do this, we might want to remove the standard behavior of the three actions associated with BRIEF, SUPERBRIEF, and VERBOSE, replacing them with explanatory messages about how the game behaves. We cannot use Instead to override these actions, because Instead rules do not apply to actions out of world. Instead, we will want to remove and replace the carry out rules.</p>
            <p>We can do this easily by going to the Actions Index, looking up the detail panel for, say, &quot;preferring abbreviated room descriptions&quot;, and click the &quot;unlist&quot; button to paste in the sentence that will remove this rule from the rulebook.</p>

            <p>Suppose we want to let the player explicitly sit, stand, or lie down on different enterable objects. (Normally Inform treats all these actions as entering, but there may be cases where we want to distinguish between the player sitting on a chair and the player standing on it.)</p>
            <p>Our implementation gives each kind of enterable a range of allowed postures, and one preferred posture. If the player enters the supporter or container without specifying a posture (as in ENTER CHAIR), he will be put in the preferred posture. If he explicitly says, e.g., STAND ON CHAIR, he will be put in the standing position as long as standing is a posture that suits the chair.</p>

            <p>Inform's default assumption is that if a player on an enterable object drops something, the dropped article winds up beside him on the same supporter or in the same container. This makes lots of sense for a dais, say, or a king-sized bed. It's a little less sensible if the enterable supporter in question is a bar stool or the like. So suppose we want to add a new kind of supporter called a perch, where everything dropped lands on the floor.</p>
            <p>There are actually several ways of implementing this, but one of them is to reach right into the drop action and replace the &quot;standard dropping rule&quot; with a different one of our own invention -- like this:</p>
