    <p class="sectionheading">§9.4. When play ends</p>
    <p>Short of something like a power cut, the story can only end when one of the two participants chooses to end it: either the player, by deciding that enough is enough, or us.</p>
    <p>In story-telling, there are many kinds of ending: happy, sad, decisive, bittersweet, surprise. Inform doesn't try to interfere in that kind of artistic choice, but it does need to know one thing about the ending: is it final, or not? Many authors like to make additional menu items available if the player has completed the story right through, but not if she has reached an early or wrong ending. (See the activity &quot;amusing a victorious player&quot;, for example.)</p>

    <p>    This phrase ends the story at the next opportunity (typically as soon as the current rule ends), with the closing message &quot;The End.&quot; The end is considered final, and any hidden menu options will be revealed.</p>

    <p>    This phrase ends the story at the next opportunity (typically as soon as the current rule ends), with the closing message given in the text. The end is not considered final. Example:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2084"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2084"></a>end the story saying &quot;You have been stymied&quot;
    </p>

            <!--END PHRASE-->
            <!--definition of ph_endfinallysaying-->

    <p>    This phrase ends the story at the next opportunity (typically as soon as the current rule ends), with the closing message given in the text. The end is considered final, and any hidden menu options will be revealed. Example:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2085"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2085"></a>end the story finally saying &quot;You have defeated Sauron&quot;
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->

        <!--end definition-->
    </div>

    <p>The closing message is traditionally set out in asterisks:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2086"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2086"></a>*** The End ***
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>This style is traditional in IF, and goes back to 1980 if not earlier.</p>
    <p>We can test the current state like so:</p>

        <div class="definition">

            <!--END PHRASE-->
            <!--definition of ph_ended-->

    <p>    This condition is true if an end has been declared using one of the &quot;end the story...&quot; phrases.</p>

    </div>

        <!--START PHRASE "defn95"-->
        <div class="definition">

            <!--END PHRASE-->
            <!--definition of ph_finallyended-->

    <p>    This condition is true if an end has been declared using one of the &quot;end the story finally...&quot; phrases, so that an ending has been reached which the author feels is a completion of the player's experience.</p>

        <!--end definition-->

            <!--END PHRASE-->
            <!--definition of ph_notfinallyended-->

    <p>    This condition is true if an end has been declared using one of the &quot;end the story...&quot; phrases, but not &quot;finally&quot;, so the author feels that the player can get further experience by playing again and trying different approaches.</p>

        <!--end definition-->
    </div>

    <p>The rulebook &quot;when play ends&quot; is the matching bookend to &quot;when play begins&quot;. It is followed when the story decides to end (not when the player simply gives up and quits), and before any epitaph like</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2087"-->

    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>appears. For example:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2088"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2088"></a>When play ends, say &quot;Oh dear.&quot;
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Surprisingly, the end is not always the end:</p>
        <!--START PHRASE "defn98"-->
        <div class="definition">
            <a id="defn98"></a><p class='defnprototype'><b>resume the story</b></p>

            <!--END PHRASE-->
            <!--definition of ph_resume-->

    <p>    This phrase causes an ended story to resume exactly as if no &quot;end the story...&quot; phrase had been used. Example:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2089"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2089"></a>When play ends:
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the story has not ended finally:
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;Oh dear. Still, here's another chance.&quot;;
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;resume the story.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>The phrase is likely to be sensible only as part of a &quot;when play ends&quot; rule. Other traditional uses include giving the player three lives, as in an old-school arcade machine.</p>
