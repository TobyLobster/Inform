    <p class="sectionheading">§3.3. Position Within Rooms</p>
    <p>Inform's division of geography into &quot;rooms&quot; is a good compromise for most purposes. The rooms are cut off from each other by (imaginary or actual) walls, while all of the interior of a given room is regarded as the same place.</p>
    <p>Suppose we want things to happen differently in different corners of the same room? Inform can already do this a little, in that the player can be inside an enterable container or on an enterable supporter. For instance:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c10007"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c10007"></a>Instead of opening a door when the player is on the bed, say &quot;You can't reach the handle from the bed.&quot;
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>If we need to have divided-up areas of the floor itself, the standard approach is to define a small number of named positions. We then need to remember at which of these locations the player (or something else) currently stands.</p>
    <p><span class="boldface">Further Reasons Why All Poets Are Liars</span> allows the player to be in different parts of a room by standing on a box which can be in different places: thus only the box needs an internal position, not the player, simplifying matters neatly.</p>
    <p>Another interesting case is when one room is entirely inside another (such as a hut in a field, or a booth in a large convention hall), so that the exterior of the room should be visible from another location. <span class="boldface">Starry Void</span> gives a simple demonstration of a magician's booth that can be examined from the outside, opened and closed, and entered to reach a new location.</p>
