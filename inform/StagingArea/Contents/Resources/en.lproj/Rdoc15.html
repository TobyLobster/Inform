    <p class="sectionheading">§3.8. Sounds</p>
    <p>It is too easily assumed that room descriptions are what the player sees, but as <span class="boldface">The Undertomb</span> demonstrates, they might just as easily include ambient sounds.</p>
    <p>So Inform's &quot;listening to&quot; action is the audio equivalent of &quot;examining&quot;, rather than &quot;looking&quot;. Despite this the player can type LISTEN, which Inform understands as listening to the everything in the location at once. A simple but effective way to handle this is shown in <span class="boldface">The Art of Noise</span>.</p>
    <p><span class="boldface">Four Stars 2</span> adjusts the idea of &quot;visibility&quot; to make it behave differently for listening purposes: this introduces a formal idea of &quot;audibility&quot;.</p>
