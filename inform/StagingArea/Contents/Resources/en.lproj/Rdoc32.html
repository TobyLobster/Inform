    <p>Looking is quite a complicated command, since the production of a room description takes many steps. A detailed description of this process may be found in the Room Descriptions section.</p>
    <p>By convention, a player sees full descriptions of rooms they enter more than once, but may type BRIEF in order to see shorter descriptions, and SUPERBRIEF tells the story never to print room descriptions at all. VERBOSE restores the default behavior.</p>
    <p>These conventions are not always appropriate, however, especially in works where experiencing a changing environment is essential. The use option</p>
