    <p class="sectionheading">§11.18. The value after and the value before</p>
    <p>A point which has come up several times in recent chapters is that enumerated kinds of value have a natural ordering. For example, if we write:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c3069"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3069"></a>Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>...then we not only have seven possible values, we have put them into a sequence, in order of their naming. We can't perform arithmetic on colours, of course, but we can perform comparisons on them. Thus &quot;red &lt; yellow&quot; is true, while &quot;green &gt;= violet&quot; is not. (More on comparisons in the chapter on Numbers and Equations, which also covers arithmetic.)</p>
    <p>It's also sometimes useful to get at the sequence directly. First, the two ends:</p>
        <!--START PHRASE "defn140"-->
        <div class="definition">
            <a id="defn140"></a><p class='defnprototype'><b>first value of </b>(name of kind)<b> ... value</b></p>

            <!--END PHRASE-->
            <!--definition of ph_enumfirst-->

    <p>    This phrase produces the first-created value of the given kind, which should be an enumeration. Example: if we have</p>
    <!--START CODE "c3070"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3070"></a>Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>then &quot;first value of colour&quot; is red.</p>

        <!--end definition-->
    </div>

        <div class="definition">

            <!--END PHRASE-->
            <!--definition of ph_enumlast-->

    <p>    This phrase produces the last-created value of the given kind, which should be an enumeration. Example: if we have</p>

            <!--END PHRASE-->
            <!--definition of ph_enumafter-->

    <p>    This phrase produces the next-created value of the given kind, which should be an enumeration. Example: if we have</p>
    <!--START CODE "c3072"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3072"></a>Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>then &quot;colour after orange&quot; is yellow.</p>

        <!--end definition-->
    </div>

        <!--START PHRASE "defn143"-->
        <div class="definition">
