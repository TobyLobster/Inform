    <p class="sectionheading">§7.15. Goal-Seeking Characters</p>
    <p>Goal-seeking characters are the most advanced IF life-form: they want to achieve specific outcomes, and they are able to work out plans of approach in order to bring these things about. They walk to rooms, open containers to search for things, use keys and tools, and ask leading questions in conversation.</p>
    <p>A really advanced implementation of goal-seeking behavior is beyond the scope of our examples (though extensions exist that treat the problem more thoroughly). We can accomplish a surprising amount without heavy customization, though, if we keep in mind three points of technique:</p>
    <p>First: it helps to think abstractly and to create broadly-defined actions as a first step to more specific tasks. For instance, a character's goal might be to eat some dinner. He'd be equally satisfied with spaghetti carbonara or with braised lamb shanks, but he needs to figure out which is available. So we might have our every turn rule (or whatever we're using to activate the character) say something like</p>
    <!--START CODE "c13344"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c13344"></a>Every turn when Clark is hungry:
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;try Clark dining.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Dining would then be an action we've defined specially, which looks around Clark's environment for suitable food; if it finds food, it issues a</p>
    <!--START CODE "c13345"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c13345"></a>try Clark eating the suitable food;
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>command; but if not, it sends Clark off to look for something likely. <span class="boldface">The Man of Steel</span> demonstrates the use of this.</p>
    <p>Second: though it doesn't actually contribute to the goal-seeking per se, lively reporting brings characters' generated behavior to life.</p>
    <!--START CODE "c13346"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c13346"></a>Clark eats a donut.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>doesn't characterize Clark very much, even though the eating may be part of a subtle, intelligent plan to seduce Lois Lane. We'll do better if we replace a lot of the character reporting rules: to that end, see the example <span class="boldface">The Man of Steel Excuses Himself</span>.</p>
    <p>Third: goal-seeking characters notice when something is in the way of the action they want to perform. When that happens, they form a plan about how to remove the obstacle. We've already seen this kind of implementation on the player's behalf: the player will pick up items before eating them, say. We can use Before rules to do similar things for other characters, as in</p>
    <!--START CODE "c13347"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c13347"></a>Before Clark eating the wrapped candy:
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;try Clark unwrapping the candy;
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the candy is wrapped, stop the action.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Here we've set things up so that if Clark tries to eat the wrapped candy, he'll be interrupted by this other command; and if his unwrapping-the-candy attempt fails, he won't go on and eat the thing. <span class="boldface">IQ Test</span> demonstrates a character who shows this kind of planning intelligence.</p>
    <p>Because before-rules chain neatly, we can trigger whole plans of behavior if we have a sensible set, as in</p>
    <!--START CODE "c13348"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c13348"></a>Before someone entering a closed container: try the person asked opening the noun.
    <br>
    Before someone opening a locked container: try the person asked unlocking the noun.
    <br>
    Before someone unlocking a locked container: ...
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>We must exercise a little bit of care if it is possible for the chain of actions to produce an endless loop - e.g., the character trying to take a key that is inside the transparent, locked box that it opens might repeatedly try to open the box, first unlocking the box, first taking the key, first opening the box, ... <span class="boldface">Boston Cream</span> is a fully-worked scenario that deals with such a set of conundra.</p>

            <p>It will sometimes be handy to write actions that are only available to the non-player characters and not to the player. To do this, we just define an action which has no &quot;understand&quot;: the player will never be able to specify this command himself, but other characters can try it.</p>
            <p>This is particularly useful for creating abstract or general actions for when we want a character to eat something, wear something, or go somewhere, but aren't too particular as to what the object is; as here, where we just want Clark to move away from the kryptonite, regardless of direction:</p>

            <p>It's good to be careful, as the library report rules have been designed and tested to describe every contingency (going through doors, going in vehicles, etc.): so when replacing a report rule, we should try to consider all the possible variations of the action that we might want to describe.</p>
            <p>However, in this case, our scenario is so simple that there are no doors, vehicles, or pushable objects, so we're safe in giving Clark a very simple reporting scheme.</p>
