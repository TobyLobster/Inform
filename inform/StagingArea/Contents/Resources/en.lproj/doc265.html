    <p class="sectionheading">§17.3. Overriding existing commands</p>
    <p>Suppose we are devising specialist commands for a game of whist, and we want &quot;discard&quot; as one of them. Looking at the table of commands in the Action index, we find that, inconveniently enough, &quot;discard&quot; already has a meaning: it is synonymous with &quot;drop&quot;, and while that might be sensible most of the time, it is perfectly wrong now. We need a way to free up &quot;discard&quot; for our own use. We can do that by:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c5587"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c5587"></a>Understand the command &quot;discard&quot; as something new.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>This cuts it loose, so to speak, and ready to be given new meanings. If we check the Actions index again, we find no mention of &quot;discard&quot; - it is now a blank slate - but &quot;drop&quot; is still exactly as it was. We could now say something like:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c5588"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c5588"></a>Understand &quot;discard [something]&quot; as discarding.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>(If we had declared that &quot;drop&quot; was something new, the whole thing would have happened in reverse, with &quot;discard&quot; retaining all of the original grammar. Inform does not distinguish between a command and its synonym.)</p>
    <p>The &quot;... as something new&quot; sentence works even for a command which did not exist anyway, for instance with:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c5589"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c5589"></a>Understand the command &quot;zylqix&quot; as something new.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Of course this does nothing - but it is intentional that it generates no problem messages: it means that the sentence can be used to force a command to be fresh and untouched by previous definitions, which might be useful when working with extensions by other people.</p>
    <p>It is also possible to clear out all the commands leading to a given action:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c5590"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c5590"></a>Understand nothing as taking.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>The commands &quot;take&quot; and &quot;get&quot; will still exist, but now they'll only have their other senses (for taking off clothes, for getting out of boxes).</p>

            <!--END CODE-->
            <p>In our new system, we want to specify what is being used for an attack. This means that we need to create a new &quot;attacking it with&quot; action, and also that we should disable the existing &quot;attacking...&quot; command.</p>
            <p>Here's why: If we leave the default attack command in place, Inform will continue to accept commands like &gt;ATTACK GLADIATOR, but reply foolishly with the default &quot;Violence is not the answer...&quot; response.</p>
            <p>A somewhat better approach would be to change the reply of &gt;ATTACK GLADIATOR to say something like &quot;You must specify a weapon to attack with.&quot; But this is still less than ideal, because it means that the player has to then rewrite the entire command. If, on the other hand, we take out &quot;ATTACK GLADIATOR&quot; entirely, the game will always prompt &quot;What do you want to attack the gladiator with?&quot; -- which teaches the player the correct command structure for this particular game, and avoids pretending to understand any command that is not meaningful within this game.</p>
            <p>This is a little bit of work because ATTACK has a lot of synonyms in the default library, but if we look through the actions index we can find them all:</p>

            <!--END CODE-->
            <p>Note that we've specified &quot;one carried thing&quot;, because we want the player to pick up a weapon to use if necessary. And now we assign all the old attack vocabulary to apply to the new command:</p>

            <p>This may seem counter-intuitive, but order of source code matters here: we first get rid of the old, default vocabulary, then define our new action, then make the vocabulary apply to that new action. Inform will now understand &gt;HIT GLADIATOR WITH TRIDENT, &gt;BREAK GLADIATOR WITH TRIDENT, and so on.</p>
            <p>Our new action is also a perfect place to use an action variable: we're going to need to choose an amount of damage done and refer to that several times in our action rules. So let's set that up first:</p>
