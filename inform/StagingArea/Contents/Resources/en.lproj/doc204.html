    <p class="sectionheading">§13.9. Defining new assertion verbs</p>
    <p>Here is an example definition of a new verb:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c3910"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3910"></a>The verb to sport means the wearing relation.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Once this is done, we can write the assertion</p>
    <!--START CODE "c3911"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3911"></a>Mr Wickham sports a Tory rosette.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>which will do the the same thing as</p>
    <!--START CODE "c3912"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3912"></a>Mr Wickham wears a Tory rosette.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>because both verbs have the same relation as their meaning.</p>
    <p>Earlier versions of Inform needed to be told how to make other parts of the verb, but that's rarely true now. Just writing:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c3913"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3913"></a>The verb to sport means the wearing relation.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>is enough for Inform to understand &quot;he sports&quot;, &quot;they sport&quot;, &quot;he sported&quot;, &quot;it is sported&quot;, &quot;he is sporting&quot;, &quot;he had sported&quot; and so on. It works with irregular verbs, too; it has a very comprehensive dictionary. But it's legal to spell out the conjugation if need be:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c3914"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3914"></a>The verb to sport (he sports, they sport, he sported, it is sported) implies the knowledge relation.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Occasionally it's convenient to have the relation the other way around. For instance:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c3915"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3915"></a>The verb to grace means the reversed wearing relation.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>With that defined, these two sentences have identical meanings:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c3916"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3916"></a>Mr Wickham sports a Tory rosette.
    <br>
    A Tory rosette graces Mr Wickham.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Reversed in this sense means that the things related - the subject and object of the verb - are the other way round.</p>
    <p>The Phrasebook index contains all the verbs associated with assertions, in the Verbs section. When we add new verbs to our source, those will appear in the Phrasebook as well.</p>
    <p>The verbs above (&quot;to grace&quot;, &quot;to sport&quot;) are short ones, but we're free to make them longer than that. For example:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c3917"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3917"></a>The verb to cover oneself with means the wearing relation.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <!--START CODE "c3918"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3918"></a>Peter is covering himself with a tent-like raincoat.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Here we have &quot;to cover oneself with&quot;, four words long; the limit is 29.</p>

                    People are to be grouped into alliances. To kiss someone is to join his or her faction, which may make a grand alliance; to strike them is to give notice of quitting, and to become a lone wolf.</p>

                    An adaptive hint system that tracks what the player needs to have seen or to possess in order to solve a given puzzle, and doles out suggestions accordingly. Handles changes in the game state with remarkable flexibility, and allows the player to decide how explicit a nudge he wants at any given moment.</p>

            <p>Hint systems in IF come in a variety of flavors: some are a static, prewritten set of guidelines (which might exist in a menu or outside the game entirely); others are built in as part of the program, and attempt to adapt to the situation the player currently faces. Adaptive hints have the advantage that they are less likely to reveal information for which the player is not ready, and the disadvantage that they are more work for the author.</p>
            <p>The exercise here is to write an adaptive hint system that will both respond in agile ways to the state of the world model and require a minimum of authorial fussing. We also want the player to be able to ask for a hint about any object he encounters in the game world: this will let him be specific and avoid accidentally receiving hints about the wrong puzzles.</p>
            <p>Our baseline assumption is that a player may find a puzzle unsolvable for one of two reasons: he either hasn't seen the relevant clue, or he hasn't got the relevant equipment. If these are true, then he should be given hints about how to find this information, and then once he has it, more specific hints about the puzzle itself -- ending, as a last resort, with the exact command(s) he will need to use in order to bring about the solution.</p>
            <p>In practice, there are other possibilities, but this will do for an example.</p>
            <p>We begin by defining our relations:</p>
