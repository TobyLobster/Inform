    <p class="sectionheading">§12.12. Check rules for actions by other people</p>
    <p>If we want to impose the restriction about carrying the camera on other people, we need a rule like the following:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c3477"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3477"></a>Check someone photographing: if the person asked does not carry the camera, stop the action.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Implicitly, that &quot;someone&quot; excludes the player. Note that we say nothing in this rule, stopping the action without a word: after all, Clark might well be out of sight when trying this. If he is within sight, then we read:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c3478"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3478"></a>&gt;clark, photograph me
    <br>
    Clark Gable is unable to do that.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>We saw before that Inform's built-in rules all have handy names (the &quot;can't drop what's already dropped rule&quot;, and such), and that these are useful when writing better &quot;unable to...&quot; messages. So for a deluxe version, we end up with:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c3479"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3479"></a>Check someone trying photographing (this is the other people can't photograph without the camera rule): if the person asked does not carry the camera, stop the action.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>And now, with ACTIONS on, we find that:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c3480"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3480"></a>&gt;clark, photograph me
    <br>
    [asking Clark Gable to try photographing yourself]
    <br>
    [(1) Clark Gable photographing yourself]
    <br>
    [(1) Clark Gable photographing yourself - failed the other people can't photograph without the camera rule]
    <br>
    Clark Gable is unable to do that.
    <br>
    [asking Clark Gable to try photographing yourself - succeeded]
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>which means that we could have, say,</p>
    <!--START CODE "c3481"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3481"></a>Unsuccessful attempt by Clark photographing:
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the reason the action failed is the other people can't photograph without the camera rule, say &quot;Clark is too suave to be embarrassed. 'Frankly, my dear, I don't have a camera.'&quot;;
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;otherwise say &quot;Clark tries, and fails, to take a photograph.&quot;
