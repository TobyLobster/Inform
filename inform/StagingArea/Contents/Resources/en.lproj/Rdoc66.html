    <p>Most domestic furniture consists of supporters and containers of one size or another. This means that the simplest furniture needs no elaborate instructions:</p>

    <p>The examples below are therefore mostly ways to get around the usual restrictions on containers (that they only have one interior) and supporters (that they cannot simultaneously be containers as well).</p>
    <p><span class="boldface">Yolk of Gold</span> provides a set of drawers, that is, a container with multiple interiors.</p>
    <p><span class="boldface">U-Stor-It</span> provides a way to have containers with a lid which is also a supporter.</p>
    <p><span class="boldface">Swigmore</span> provides a supporter which holds up the player, but has no top surface as such, and cannot hold up anything else. <span class="boldface">Kiwi</span> demonstrates a kind of high shelf, whose objects cannot be seen or used unless the player stands on a ladder.</p>
    <p><span class="boldface">Princess and the Pea</span> shows how a pile of supporters, each on top of the last, could be managed.</p>

    <p><span class="boldface">Circle of Misery</span> demonstrates a conveyor belt, which can hold multiple items but only brings one of them within the player's reach at a time.</p>

            <p>Within a room, we might have containers and supporters that a player can enter. A chair, stool, table, dais, or pedestal would be an enterable supporter (anything we would describe a person as being &quot;on&quot;); a cage, hammock, or booth would be an enterable container (because we would describe the person as being &quot;inside&quot;).</p>
            <p>When the player is in or on something, he is able to see the rest of the contents of the room, but a note such as &quot;(in the hammock)&quot; or &quot;(on the poster bed)&quot; is added to the room title when he looks around.</p>

            <p>In order to resolve this, we want to set up a raised supporter kind. When something is on a raised supporter, it should be mentioned to the player only if the player is in the right position (i.e., standing on something) and otherwise omitted from the description entirely.</p>

            <p>The only point we need to be careful about is that the carousel is simulated twice over, in the following text: once in the built-in way that objects are inside other objects, so that the luggage items are objects contained in the carousel object; but then again by the &quot;circle of misery&quot; list, a ring buffer keeping track of what order things are in. We need to be careful that these two records do not fall out of synchrony: anything put into the carousel must be added to the list, anything taken out must be removed.

            <p>Inform's default assumption is that if a player on an enterable object drops something, the dropped article winds up beside him on the same supporter or in the same container. This makes lots of sense for a dais, say, or a king-sized bed. It's a little less sensible if the enterable supporter in question is a bar stool or the like. So suppose we want to add a new kind of supporter called a perch, where everything dropped lands on the floor.</p>
            <p>There are actually several ways of implementing this, but one of them is to reach right into the drop action and replace the &quot;standard dropping rule&quot; with a different one of our own invention -- like this:</p>
