    <p class="sectionheading">§11.14. Phrase options</p>
    <p>There are sometimes several slightly different ways to perform a given task but which have substantially the same definition. In the following example:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2984"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2984"></a>To go hiking, into the woods or up the mountain:
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if into the woods, say &quot;Watch out for badgers.&quot;;
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if up the mountain, say &quot;Better take your compass.&quot;;
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;You go hiking.&quot;
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>...a phrase has been set up which can be used in three ways:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2985"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2985"></a>go hiking;
    <br>
    go hiking, into the woods;
    <br>
    go hiking, up the mountain;
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Note that commas must be used to divide these &quot;phrase options&quot; from the rest of the text of the phrase. Within the definition of the phrase, the option's name is a valid condition, and</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2986"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2986"></a>if up the mountain, ...
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>tests whether it is set; we can also test if it is not set using:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2987"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2987"></a>if not up the mountain, ...
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>A more substantial example from the Standard Rules is given by a phrase used mostly for internal, technical reasons:</p>
        <!--START PHRASE "defn134"-->
        <div class="definition">
            <a id="defn134"></a><p class='defnprototype'><b>list the contents of </b>(object)<b></b></p>

            <!--END PHRASE-->
            <!--definition of ph_listcontents-->

    <p>    This phrase produces a list of all things whose holder is the given object, according to Inform's traditional conventions for room descriptions and inventory listings. Example:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2988"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2988"></a>list the contents of Marley Wood, as a sentence, with newlines
    <br>
    and including all contents;
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Where this is possible, it's generally better to use &quot;[list of things in ...]&quot; instead, which produces the same result in an acceptable way for the middle of a sentence.</p>

        <!--end definition-->
    </div>

    <p>Note that this phrase is allowed to have multiple options specified, whereas &quot;go hiking&quot; above was not: this is because it was defined thus:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2989"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2989"></a>To list the contents of (something - an object), with newlines, indented, as a sentence, including contents, including all contents, giving inventory information, giving brief inventory information, using the definite article, listing marked items only, prefacing with is/are, not listing concealed items, suppressing all articles and/or with extra indentation: ...
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>The significant difference is the word &quot;and/or&quot; instead of &quot;or&quot;, which signals that more than one option can apply at a time.</p>

            <p>Most of the phrase options above are relatively self-explanatory; a few are less so. Here is an overview:</p>
            <p>&quot;With newlines&quot; tells Inform to put a new line before each listed object. Indented tells it to indent contents of objects, when listing these.</p>
            <p>&quot;Giving inventory information&quot; means to append information such as (closed) or (being worn) to objects.</p>
            <p>&quot;As a sentence&quot; means to put &quot;and&quot; before the last object and commas between them; this is usually not used in conjunction with newline listing. &quot;As a sentence&quot; obeys whatever conventions about the use of the serial comma we may have established with the &quot;Use serial comma&quot; option.</p>
            <p>&quot;Including contents&quot; means to list the contents of open or transparent containers and all supporters, whereas including all contents means to list the contents of all containers, even opaque closed ones.</p>
            <p>&quot;Tersely&quot;, perhaps unexpectedly, puts parentheses around objects listed as the contents of other objects.</p>
            <p>&quot;Giving brief inventory information&quot; omits most of the inventory tags, such as &quot;(open)&quot; and &quot;(worn)&quot;, but does list &quot;(closed)&quot; for closed containers which might not otherwise be obviously openable.</p>
            <p>&quot;Using the definite article&quot; means prefixing objects with &quot;the&quot;, if applicable, rather than &quot;a&quot;.</p>
            <p>&quot;Listing marked items only&quot; means including only objects that have already been declared &quot;marked for listing&quot;.</p>
            <p>&quot;Prefacing with is-are&quot; means that Inform will write &quot;is&quot; before the list if it contains only one item, and &quot;are&quot; if the list contains more than one.</p>
            <p>&quot;Not listing concealed items&quot; means to omit from the list anything which is scenery.</p>
            <p>Finally, &quot;with extra indentation&quot; means that the whole list should be indented slightly, in emulation of the default inventory listing.</p>
            <p>With this information, we can try rewriting the inventory behavior to emulate the standard or to explore alternate versions:</p>
