    <p class="sectionheading">§11.16. New conditions, new adjectives</p>
    <p>We can create new conditions by defining a phrase with &quot;to decide whether&quot; (or equivalently &quot;to decide if&quot;):</p>
    <!--START CODE "c3017"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3017"></a>To decide whether danger lurks:
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if in darkness, decide yes;
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the Control Room has been visited, decide no;
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;decide yes.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>If the player is indeed in darkness, the decision is &quot;yes&quot; because the &quot;decide yes&quot; stops the process right there. We can now write, for instance,</p>
    <!--START CODE "c3018"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3018"></a>if danger lurks, ...
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>In fact, &quot;danger lurks&quot; is now a condition as good as any other, and can be used wherever a condition would be given. Rules can apply only &quot;when danger lurks&quot;, for instance.</p>
        <!--START PHRASE "defn137"-->
        <div class="definition">
            <a id="defn137"></a><p class='defnprototype'><b>yes</b></p>
            <br>
            <i>or:</i>&#160;&#160;&#160;<p class='defnprototype'><b>decide yes</b></p>

            <!--END PHRASE-->
            <!--definition of ph_yes-->

    <p>    This phrase can only be used in the definition of a phrase to decide whether a condition holds. It ends the decision process immediately and makes the condition true.</p>

        <!--end definition-->
    </div>

        <!--START PHRASE "defn138"-->
        <div class="definition">
            <a id="defn138"></a><p class='defnprototype'><b>no</b></p>
            <br>
            <i>or:</i>&#160;&#160;&#160;<p class='defnprototype'><b>decide no</b></p>

            <!--END PHRASE-->
            <!--definition of ph_no-->

    <p>    This phrase can only be used in the definition of a phrase to decide whether a condition holds. It ends the decision process immediately and makes the condition false.</p>

        <!--end definition-->
    </div>

    <p>We can also supply definitions of adjectives like this. So far, new adjectives have been defined like so:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c3019"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3019"></a><a href="javascript:pasteCode('Definition: a supporter is occupied if it is described and something is on it.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]\n')"><img alt="paste@2x.png" src="inform:/doc_images/paste@2x.png" width="13" height="13"></a> Definition: a supporter is occupied if it is described and something is on it.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>If we want to give a definition which involves more complex logic, we can use a special form allowing us to make arbitrary decisions. In this longer format, the same definition would look like so:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c3020"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3020"></a><a href="javascript:pasteCode('Definition: a supporter is occupied:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]if it is undescribed, decide no;[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]if something is on it, decide yes;[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]decide no.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]\n')"><img alt="paste@2x.png" src="inform:/doc_images/paste@2x.png" width="13" height="13"></a> Definition: a supporter is occupied:
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if it is undescribed, decide no;
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if something is on it, decide yes;
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;decide no.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Here &quot;it&quot; refers to the supporter in question. Note that there are now two colons in this sentence, one after &quot;Definition&quot;, the other after the clause being defined. But that apart, it's a phrase like any other: it must end in &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; just as the &quot;danger lurks&quot; example must. &quot;Decide no&quot; and &quot;decide yes&quot; are needed so often that they can be abbreviated by leaving out &quot;decide&quot;:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c3021"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3021"></a>Definition: a supporter is occupied:
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if it is undescribed, no;
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if something is on it, yes;
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;no.
    </p>

            <p>Suppose we want the game to interpret &quot;GO OUT&quot; as &quot;move towards an outdoors room, or towards a room with more exits than the current room&quot;, while &quot;GO IN&quot; means &quot;move toward a room with fewer exits, or towards an indoors room&quot;. Thus going in repeatedly within a building would lead towards dead-ends, while going out repeatedly would lead towards the center of the building and then towards an exit to the outside world.</p>
