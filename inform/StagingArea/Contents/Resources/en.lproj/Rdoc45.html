    <p>Some commands and some objects raise special challenges when it comes to working out the player's intention.</p>
    <p>Sometimes this can be done with good rules about the assumptions Inform should make. <span class="boldface">Alpaca Farm</span> demonstrates a USE command, always a challenge because USE can mean very different actions with different items.</p>
    <p>There are also times when we need to ask the player for more information. <span class="boldface">Apples</span> demonstrates how sensibly to use properties to disambiguate between similar objects, while <span class="boldface">Walls and Noses</span> rephrases the disambiguation question when special objects are involved: examining one of the walls of the room will make the story ask &quot;In which direction?&quot; and EXAMINE NOSE will lead to &quot;Whose nose do you mean, Frederica's, Betty's, Wilma's or your own?&quot;</p>
    <p>At other times, the player types something that is wrong in a predictable way: for instance, we might want to remove all the &quot;with...&quot; phrases from commands like</p>
    <!--START CODE "c12040"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c12040"></a>HIT DOOR WITH FIST
    <br>
    KICK DRAGON WITH FOOT
    <br>
    LOOK WEST WITH EYES
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>and merely parse the remainder of the command. (That last command may be unlikely, but novice players do quite often type commands that refer unnecessarily to body parts.) <span class="boldface">Cave-troll</span> demonstrates how.</p>
    <p><span class="boldface">WXPQ</span> demonstrates how to modify the error message the parser gives in response to a command it doesn't understand; this particular example focuses on the &quot;That noun doesn't make sense in this context&quot; message that arises from using the &quot;[any thing]&quot; or &quot;[any room]&quot; tokens, but the techniques could be adapted to handling other parser errors as well.</p>
    <p>For catching typing errors, Cedric Knight's extension Mistype may also be of use: it provides an automatic typo-correction function that the player can turn on or off.</p>

On the one hand, it helps avoid guess-the-verb problems where the player cannot figure out what term to use in order to express a fairly simple idea. On the other, it encourages the player to think that all items have one and exactly one use, rather than getting them to consider the range of possibilities that arise from having a complex vocabulary.</p>

            <p>Now that we've defined our &quot;matched&quot; adjective, we can use it for other purposes as well -- even generating our own lists. Our second challenge was to respond to EXAMINE NOSE with &quot;Whose nose do you mean, Frederica's, Betty's, Wilma's or your own?&quot;</p>
            <p>Here we need to change the way the question is worded (not &quot;which do you mean&quot; but &quot;whose nose do you mean&quot;). We also have to the names of the noses as they're printed in this particular context, so that they don't repeat the word &quot;nose&quot; over and over. And -- as a point of good English style -- we also want &quot;your own&quot; nose always to be last on the list.</p>
            <p>For this purpose we may want to use the built-in &quot;Complex Listing&quot; extension, which allows us to print specially ordered lists. So:</p>

            <p>Novice players of interactive fiction, unfamiliar with its conventions, will often try to add extra phrases to a command that the game cannot properly parse: HIT DOOR WITH FIST, for instance, instead of HIT DOOR.</p>
            <p>While we can deal with some of these instances by expanding our range of actions, at some point it becomes impossible to account for all the possible prepositional phrases that the player might want to tack on. So what do we do if we want to handle those appended bits of text sensibly?</p>
            <p>We could go through and remove any piece of text containing &quot;with ...&quot; from the end of a player's command; the problem with that is that it overzealously lops off the ends of valid commands like UNLOCK DOOR WITH KEY, as well. So clearly we don't want to do this as part of the &quot;After reading a command...&quot; stage.</p>
            <p>A better time to cut off the offending text is right before issuing a parser error. At that point, Inform has already determined that it definitely cannot parse the instruction as given, so we know that there's something wrong with it.</p>
            <p>The next problem, though, is that after we've edited the player's text we want to feed the corrected version back to Inform and try once more to interpret it.</p>
            <p>This is where we have a valid reason to write a new &quot;rule for reading a command&quot;. We will tell Inform that when we have just corrected the player's input to something new, it should not ask for a new command (by printing a prompt and waiting for another line of input); it should instead paste our stored corrected command back into &quot;the player's command&quot; and proceed as though that new text had just been typed.</p>
            <p>Thanks to John Clemens for the specifics of the implementation.</p>
