    <p class="sectionheading">§15.17. Totals</p>
    <p>This chapter began by mentioning arithmetic, and then went on a long diversion to create scientific units, everyday weights and measures, and other notational conveniences. Putting all of that together, it's time now to calculate something with all of these numerical quantities.</p>
    <p>Suppose we invent the idea of weight, and give everything a weight of its own. Most items will have a nominal weight of 1kg, but people will be heavier. Going on actuarial tables, we might say:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c4755"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c4755"></a>A weight is a kind of value. 10kg specifies a weight. Everything has a weight. A thing usually has weight 1kg. A man usually has weight 80kg. A woman usually has weight 67kg.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <!--START CODE "c4756"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c4756"></a>Definition: A thing is light if its weight is 3kg or less.
    <br>
    Definition: A thing is heavy if its weight is 10kg or more.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>and this provides us with &quot;lighter&quot;, &quot;lightest&quot;, &quot;heavier&quot; and &quot;heaviest&quot; as before. Now we could say &quot;if Peter is heavier than Paul&quot;, or even &quot;if Peter is heavier than 75kg&quot;, and so forth. We need one more tool:</p>
        <!--START PHRASE "defn218"-->
        <div class="definition">
            <a id="defn218"></a><p class='defnprototype'><b>total </b>(arithmetic values valued property)<b> of </b>(description of values)<b> ... value</b></p>

            <!--END PHRASE-->
            <!--definition of ph_total-->

    <p>This phrase produces the total of some property held by all of the values matching the description. A problem message is produced if the values in question can't have that property (&quot;the total carrying capacity of scenes&quot;), or if it holds a kind of value which can't meaningfully be ad ed up (&quot;the total description of open doors&quot;). Example:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c4757"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c4757"></a>total carrying capacity of people in the Deep Pool
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->

        <!--end definition-->
    </div>

    <p>That gives us everything we need for a working balance platform:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c4758"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c4758"></a>The balance platform is a supporter in the Weighbridge. &quot;The balance platform is currently weighing [the list of things on the platform]. The scale alongside reads: [total weight of things on the platform].&quot;
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Note that this only works because we said that &quot;everything has a weight&quot;: otherwise it would make no sense to add up the weights of things.</p>
    <p>This enables us to get the average weight of a group of things, too:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c4759"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c4759"></a>the total weight of things on the platform divided by the number of things on the platform
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>But we should be careful that this does not accidentally divide by zero, which it will if the platform has nothing on it! As well as the average, we could find the maximum and minimum weights:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c4760"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c4760"></a>the weight of the heaviest thing on the platform
    <br>
    the weight of the lightest thing on the platform
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>We should remember that &quot;the heaviest thing on the platform&quot; may be ambiguous, because there may be several equally heavy things there. That means</p>
    <!--START CODE "c4761"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c4761"></a>if the lead pig is the heaviest thing on the platform
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>will only reliably work if there is no possibility of a tie. A safer bet is:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c4762"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c4762"></a>if the lead pig is the weight of the heaviest thing on the platform

            <p>We also assume that all money &quot;enclosed by the buyer&quot; -- that is, somewhere in the buyer's possession -- is available for use.
