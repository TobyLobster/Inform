    <p class="sectionheading">§4.4. Plural assertions</p>
    <p>As the following examples show, sentences can make several assertions at once by using the plural. Suppose we have defined a kind called &quot;high-up fixture&quot;, for instance like so:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c580"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c580"></a>A high-up fixture is a kind of thing. A high-up fixture is usually fixed in place.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Then the following sentence creates two such objects and puts them in their place:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c581"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c581"></a>The high shelf and the skylight window are high-up fixtures in the Lumber Room.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>since it is equivalent to saying:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c582"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c582"></a>The high shelf is a high-up fixture. The skylight window is a high-up fixture. The high shelf is in the Lumber Room. The skylight window is in the Lumber Room.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Such plurals are allowed in almost any context, and we could even define two kinds at once:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c583"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c583"></a>Bucket and basket are kinds of container.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Inform constructs plurals by a form of Conway's pluralisation algorithm, which is quite good - for example, it gets oxen, geese (but mongooses), sheep, wildebeest, bream, vertebrae, quartos, wharves, phenomena, jackanapes and smallpox correct. But English is a very irregular language, and multiple-word nouns sometimes pluralise in unexpected ways. So we sometimes need to intervene:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c584"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c584"></a>A brother in law is a kind of man. The plural of brother in law is brothers in law.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>We are allowed to define more than one plural for the same singular text, and for the names of things, rooms or kinds, all alternative versions will be used interchangeably. (For instance, Inform defines both &quot;people&quot; and &quot;persons&quot; as plurals of &quot;person&quot;.)</p>

            <p>Inform's default handling of wearable things does not make any rules about what can be worn together. Suppose, however, we have a game in which there are a large number of different garments, and we want to keep the player from wearing (say) more than one pair of pants at once:</p>
