    <p class="sectionheading">§9.6. The time of day</p>
    <p>Inform keeps track of the time of day automatically: play ordinarily begins at 9 AM and each turn takes one minute. In some works of interactive fiction, time of day is crucial: in others, it is irrelevant or even, by a sort of tacit convention, non-existent. So Inform does nothing to act upon the time, or to reveal it to the player, without instruction. Nevertheless it is there.</p>
    <p>A sentence like the following allows the initial time to be set up as something other than 9 AM:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2176"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2176"></a>The time of day is 3:13 PM.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Here, &quot;3:13 PM&quot; is a constant value of a kind not seen before: it's a kind of value called &quot;time&quot;, and the value &quot;time of day&quot; is a time that varies. After one turn it will be 3:14 PM, then 3:15 PM and so on.</p>
    <p>Note that the sentence above is an assertion (a statement about the initial state of affairs), not an instruction which can be part of a rule. It would be equivalent to write:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2177"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2177"></a>When play begins: now the time of day is 3:13 PM.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>We more often change &quot;time of day&quot; to take care of drastic events:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c2178"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c2178"></a>At the time when the player loses consciousness:
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the time of day is 10:12 AM;
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;A mist comes over your vision, and when you come to, it is morning and you are in bed.&quot;

            <p>Suppose we wanted a game set in a living town, with locations opening and closing at different times of day, and business carrying on as usual. The point might be to force the player to plan his itinerary carefully to hit the right spots at the right times; or we might be writing a more contemplative piece, where part of the enjoyment came from just watching the characters wander around doing their daily business...</p>
