    <p class="sectionheading">§3.2. Map</p>
    <p>A work of IF contains many spectacles and activities, and these must not all present themselves at once, or the player will be overwhelmed. One way to spread them out is in time, by having them available only as a plot develops, but another is to spread them out literally in space. The player has to walk between the Library and the Swimming Pool, and thus bookish and athletic tasks are not both presenting themselves at once. There have been valiant &quot;one-room&quot; IFs, and it forms a respectable sub-genre of the art, but most works of any size need a map.</p>
    <p>Inform, following IF conventions, divides the world up into locations called &quot;rooms&quot;, connected together by so-called &quot;map connections&quot; along compass bearings. Thus:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c9876"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c9876"></a>The Library is east of the Swimming Pool.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>The example <span class="boldface">Port Royal 1</span> develops a medium-sized map from such sentences. This develops in <span class="boldface">Port Royal 2</span> to include connections which bend around, allowing the rooms not to lie on an imaginary square grid.</p>
    <p>Because it is useful to group rooms together under names describing whole areas, Inform also allows rooms to be placed in &quot;regions&quot;. Thus:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c9877"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c9877"></a>The Campus Area is a region. The Library and the Swimming Pool are in the Campus Area.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p><span class="boldface">Port Royal 3</span> demonstrates this further. <span class="boldface">A&amp;E</span> shows how regions can be used to write simple rules which regulate access to and from whole areas of the map.</p>
    <p>Many old-school IF puzzles involve journeys through the map which are confused, randomised or otherwise frustrated: see <span class="boldface">Bee Chambers</span> for a typical maze, <span class="boldface">Zork II</span> for a randomised connection, <span class="boldface">Prisoner's Dilemma</span> for a change in the map occurring during play. A completely random map takes us away from traditional IF and more towards a different sort of old-school game, the computerised role-playing game with its endless quests through dungeons with randomly generated treasures and monsters. This style of map - building itself one step at a time, as the player explores - can sometimes be useful to provide an illusion of infinite expanse: see <span class="boldface">All Roads Lead To Mars</span>.</p>
    <p>While the standard compass directions are conventional in IF, there are times when we may want to replace them without other forms of directional relationship. <span class="boldface">Indirection</span> renames the compass directions to correspond to primary colors, as in Mayan thinking. <span class="boldface">The World of Charles S. Roberts</span> substitutes new ones, instead, introducing a hex-grid map in place of the usual one.</p>

            <p>Clicking Go will translate this description into a sketchy but working simulation of Port Royal, in which we can type movement commands like EAST or SOUTH to explore the streets.

Like the rest of the Index, this is provided entirely for the author's benefit, and is not visible to the player.

            <p>Wargaming is an ancient pursuit, but its modern form began as a professional training exercise in 19th-century Prussian staff colleges; since at least as early as H. G. Wells's &quot;Little Wars&quot; (1913) it has been a hobby of &quot;boys from twelve years of age to one hundred and fifty and for that more intelligent sort of girl who likes boys' games and books.&quot; The free-form tabletop game used miniature figures and tape-measured movements, and remains the dominant form today. But in the mid-20th century, map grids on printed sheets gave the hobby a sudden new lease of life. They were easier to set up, more interesting to look at, cheaper to sell by mail-order. 1970s sales figures for &quot;Strategy and Tactics&quot;, the leading US subscription-based wargame distributor, were very similar to those of Infocom's IF games in the 1980s. And like classical IF, the grid-based wargame parceled up a continuous world into locations.</p>
            <p>Grids were initially square, as on a chessboard, but square cells have several disadvantages. Four directions of movement (N, E, S, W) is too few, yet allowing movement in the diagonal directions means allowing tanks to travel about 1.4 times faster northeast than they do north. Square grids also only conform cleanly to man-made landscape features such as buildings in one orientation, and they never fit hills well. (A compromise measure to fix this, cutting the squares into octagons to leave smaller diamond squares at corner intersections, has never caught on.)</p>
            <p><img alt="hexes.jpg" src="inform:/doc_images/hexes.jpg" /></p>
            <p>But following Charles S. Roberts's American Civil War designs for Avalon Hill of 1958-61 (notably &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; and the second edition of &quot;Gettysburg&quot;), a hexagonal grid became the new standard. Each hexagon is the same distance from the centre of all six of its neighbours, which are at equal angular spacings; and clumps of hexagons fit the shape of lakes, contoured hills, and so forth, much more naturally than clumps of squares do. Hexes also have a certain mystique - an air of &quot;I don't belong in the children's department&quot;.</p>
            <p>But hexes are tricky for IF, not least because English lacks words for &quot;the direction 60 degrees around from front&quot;. Our cognitive view of the world tends to be square, perhaps because our two eyes both face front, in a direction at right angles to the plane of our arms, legs, pelvis and eyes. We reach out sideways at right angles to our walking. Even early hex-grid wargames called the cells &quot;squares&quot;, though &quot;hexes&quot; eventually caught on. Still and all:</p>
