    <p>At its simplest, the interactive fiction will be simulating a physical world to explore. The forerunner of today's IF is generally agreed to be a computer simulation by Will Crowther of the exploration of a cave system in the Mammoth and Flint Ridge chain of caves in Kentucky, a part of which might be described in Inform thus:</p>

    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Here we sketch in four of Crowther's locations, and two objects: just enough to be able to walk around the caves and pick up the rod and the cage. The text in quotation marks will appear verbatim as paragraphs shown to the player as the caves are explored. The first paragraph, as we have seen, is the title of the work. The other quotations describe the places and objects introduced.</p>
    <p>If we play this story, we find that we can type TAKE CAGE or TAKE WICKER CAGE, for instance, but not TAKE SMALL CAGE. Inform saw that we called this &quot;a wicker cage&quot; when it first appeared in the source text, and assumed that the player would call it that, too. (Whereas it didn't look inside the descriptive text to allow for TAKE SMALL CAGE or TAKE DISCARDED CAGE or TAKE NEARBY CAGE.) A small limitation here is that probably only the first 9 letters of each word are read from the player's command. This is plenty for handling the wicker cage and the black rod, but it might be embarrassing at a meeting of the Justice League to find that KISS SUPERHERO and KISS SUPERHEROINE read as if they are the same command.</p>
    <p>So we have already found that Inform has made some assumptions about what we want, and imposed some limitations on how much computational effort to go to when the work of IF is finally played. If Inform guesses what we need wrongly, we need to know more advanced features of the language in order to overcome these problems. (We shall see how to change the way the player's commands are read in the chapter on Understanding.)</p>
    <p>This is often how Inform works: make the standard way of doing things as simple as possible to describe, but allow almost any behaviour to be altered by more elaborate source text. As an example of that, the player begins in the Cobble Crawl because it was the first room created in the source text, but we could instead have written text like:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c76"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c76"></a>The player is in the Cobble Crawl.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>to override that. This can make the source text easier to follow if the rooms are sometimes being created in a less obvious way. For example, if we write:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c77"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c77"></a>The silver bars are in the Y2 Rock Room.
    <br>
    The Cobble Crawl is a room. South of the Crawl is Y2.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>then the first room to be created will actually be the Y2 Rock Room, so that's where the player will be starting unless we say otherwise.</p>
