    <p class="sectionheading">§15.18. Equations</p>
    <p>Forming totals is all very interesting in its way, but it's book-keeping rather than physics. As a glance at any school science textbook shows, the way to apply physics is to work out an unknown quantity - say, the time taken for a dropped ball to hit the ground - by combining known quantities into an equation - the height it is dropped from, and the strength of gravity.</p>
    <p>It's a convention centuries old now that textbooks and research papers never describe these equations in running text. Even for simple formulae, we like to write &quot;F=ma&quot;, not &quot;let the force be the mass times the acceleration&quot;. And the standard way to print this is to break off and display an equation, not to squeeze it into the text as if it were ordinary verbiage. Just as Inform's Tables imitate those in printed books (see the next chapter), so its Equations do.</p>
    <p>In this section, we'll use a combination of three equations to work out how soon and how hard an object pushed off a table will hit the floor. First, we'll include Metric Units, to define all of the kinds of value and notations we need.</p>

    <p>Here is the calculation:</p>

    <p>Not all that fast-moving - it's only about 10 mph, ten times slower than one fired by a Renaissance cannon - but half a second wouldn't give you long to get your foot out of the way.</p>
    <p>How was that done? The crucial lines are the ones in the form &quot;let X be given by E...&quot;, which is a new form of &quot;let&quot;.</p>

            <!--definition of ph_letequation-->

    <p>    This phrase creates a new temporary variable, starting it with the value found by solving the given equation. The variable lasts only for the present block of phrases, which certainly means that it lasts only for the current rule. Example:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c4827"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c4827"></a>let F be given by Newton's Second Law where a is the acceleration due to gravity;
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>There is also a more compact syntax, giving the equation explicitly:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c4828"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c4828"></a>let KE be given by KE = mv^2/2 where KE is an energy;
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->

        <!--end definition-->
    </div>

    <p>When we solve with &quot;let&quot;, then, all of the other symbols should either already have values (because they exist as &quot;let&quot; values already made) or else be specified in the line. For instance,</p>
    <!--START CODE "c4829"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c4829"></a>let F be given by Newton's Second Law where a is the acceleration due to gravity;
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>is allowed because &quot;F&quot; is one of the symbols in &quot;F = ma&quot;; of the other two symbols, we have a &quot;let&quot; variable called &quot;m&quot; already - it's the mass of the cannon ball - and we declare exactly what &quot;a&quot; is.</p>
    <p>The next calculation is more interesting:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c4830"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c4830"></a>let v be given by the Principle of Conservation of Energy;
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Since the equation here is &quot;mgh = mv^2/2&quot;, Inform has to do some algebra to work out &quot;v&quot; in terms of the other unknowns - it's the square root of 2gh, but we don't need to work that out. Inform can't always solve implicit equations - for instance, it can't deduce &quot;m&quot; from this equation - but it's correct on all the easy cases which occur in basic physics, and that enables us to write equations in their most natural form, which is easier to read and understand.</p>
    <p>The advantage of setting out an equation formally is that it can be used in many places - we could use Newton's Second Law again for something quite different, for example. But it's a little cumbersome for something simple which we only need once, so this is neater:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c4831"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c4831"></a>let KE be given by KE = mv^2/2 where KE is an energy;
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Here the equation is written out explicitly instead of being named, but otherwise everything works in the same way.</p>
    <p>Equations can also contain many of our standard functions, which are written for this purpose with their standard mathematical abbreviations. For example:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c4832"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c4832"></a>let x be given by sin x = 1 where x is a real number;
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>works out x as pi divided by 4, which is to say, 90 degrees. The Phrasebook entries on the mathematical functions give their abbreviations, but here they all are as a list:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c4833"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c4833"></a>abs, root, ceiling, floor, int, log, exp, sin, cos, tan, arcsin, arccos, arctan, sinh, cosh, tanh, arcsinh, arccosh, arctanh
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>As an example, here's the definition of arcsinh given in the Standard Rules:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c4834"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c4834"></a>To decide which real number is the hyperbolic arcsine of (R - a real number):
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;let x be given by x = log(R + root(R^2 + 1)) where x is a real number;
    <br>
    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;decide on x.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Something to be a little cautious of: brackets are used in equations to group terms together, and do not mean function application, as they would in a C-like programming language. For example, &quot;sin(1+x)/2&quot; takes the sine of &quot;(1+x)/2&quot;: if we want to halve the sine of &quot;1+x&quot;, we have to write &quot;(sin(1+x))/2&quot;.</p>

            <p>Suppose the player is responsible for pricing at Widget Enterprises. Widget production entails a certain fixed cost as well as a cost per unit; and somewhere out in the world there are a number of customers interested in purchasing widgets, but the player starts without knowing what this distribution looks like.</p>
            <p>We can express the profits as an equation: the total made by selling widgets, minus the cost thereof.</p>
            <p>The Table of Customers holds the data about customer preferences, and whenever the player selects a widget price, we consult it to determine how many customers in total would be willing to buy at that price.</p>
