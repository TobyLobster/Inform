    <p class="sectionheading">§18.26. Printing the locale description of something</p>
    <p><span class="boldface">1. When it happens.</span> A &quot;locale description&quot; is Inform jargon for the part of a room description which catalogues the visible items in the room. When looking, Inform will normally print the description of the room itself, followed by a locale description for the room. But if the player is in a cage in the room, there will be two locale descriptions: one for the room, then another for the cage. This activity is used to write the locale description for a single domain, and the &quot;something&quot; can be either a room, an enterable container, or an enterable supporter.</p>
    <p><span class="boldface">2. The default behaviour.</span> Is quite complicated, and is written up in full in the typeset form of the Standard Rules downloadable from the Inform website. Briefly, though: we first run the &quot;choosing notable locale objects&quot; activity to find out what ought to be mentioned here. That assembles a list of things to mention, sorted into priority order. Items with priority 1 go first, then those with priority 2, and so on. The &quot;printing a locale paragraph&quot; activity is run for each, and in practice that usually hands the job over to &quot;writing a paragraph about&quot;. Sometimes a paragraph will indeed be written, but not always. Sometimes there is nothing interesting to say, and an item is left until a final, single paragraph which gathers up the leftovers (&quot;You can also see a scarlet fish, a harmonium and a kite here.&quot;), the printing of which is done by the &quot;listing nondescript items of&quot; activity. As soon as any item picks up the either/or property &quot;mentioned&quot;, by having its name printed, it is struck out so that it will not appear subsequently, whatever its priority.</p>
    <p><span class="boldface">3. Examples.</span> As general advice: if the effect wanted can be got using &quot;writing a paragraph about&quot; and &quot;listing nondescript items of&quot; alone, use those; if it's necessary to meddle further, use &quot;choosing notable locale objects&quot; and &quot;printing a locale paragraph&quot; to alter the normal processes; use the all-powerful &quot;printing the locale description&quot; activity only when the whole process needs to be altered, not the item-by-item workings.</p>
    <p>(a) In the Very Misty Moorlands, nothing on the ground can ordinarily be seen through the swirling mist, so the locale description is suppressed entirely:</p>

            <p>In order for the priorities we just set to be interesting, let's give out some initial appearances and writing a paragraph rules:</p>
            <!--START CODE "c6823_300"-->
            <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c6823_300"></a>The initial appearance of the worm is &quot;A worm inches along the ground.&quot;
            <br>
            The initial appearance of the late edition is &quot;Finally, the late edition lies at your feet.&quot;
            </p>
            </blockquote>
            <!--END CODE-->
            <!--START CODE "c6824_300"-->
            <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c6824_300"></a>Rule for writing a paragraph about the early bird when the early bird is in a room: say &quot;The early bird always appears first, and here it is.&quot;
            <br>
            Rule for writing a paragraph about the leaf: say &quot;Look, there's [a leaf][unless the leaf is in the location] on [the holder of the leaf][end if]!&quot;
            <br>
            Rule for writing a paragraph about an icky thing (called icky item) which is on something which supports the player: say &quot;Ew, [an icky item] is right next to you.&quot;
            </p>
            </blockquote>
            <!--END CODE-->
            <p>This procedure also means (as you can test by experiment) that after the late edition has been picked up and dropped again, it lists in no special order in the &quot;you can see...&quot; paragraph (since initial appearances only print when the object has not yet been moved).</p>
            <!--START CODE "c6825_300"-->
            <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c6825_300"></a>The afterthought is a thing in the Priority Lab. It is latest-described.
            </p>
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c6826_300"></a>The bar stool is an enterable supporter in Priority Lab.
            </p>
