    <p>&quot;Disenchantment Bay&quot; is a simple work of IF used as a running example in Chapter 3 of <span class="italic">Writing with Inform</span> - not so much a tutorial as a convenient hook on which to hang some demonstrations of the basics. Because the resulting examples only use basic features and in the most straightforward way, they make for uninteresting &quot;recipes&quot; - so they are not included in the <span class="italic">Recipe Book</span> proper. But some readers might like to have all twelve stages of the example gathered on a single page: this is that page.</p>

            <p>Now there's a silver key that will unlock it -- though since we haven't said where the key is, the player will never be able to find it in the game. (If we look at the World index, we find &quot;small silver key&quot; right at the bottom, not inside any of the rooms. That is as good as not existing at all -- though we usually use the term &quot;out of play&quot; -- but as we will later see, it is possible to have things initially out of play but brought into existence later on.)</p>
