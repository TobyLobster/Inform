    <p class="sectionheading">§10.9. Heat</p>
    <p>Since we prefer not to simulate burnt skin, and it is unsporting to kill a player outright merely for touching a hot object, heat is mostly used as a reason why something cannot be picked up at a given moment. This very basic puzzle is demonstrated in <span class="boldface">Grilling</span>.</p>
    <p>With the naked eye, it is not always easy to detect what is too hot to touch - a point made in both <span class="boldface">Masochism Deli</span>, where the only solution is to keep picking up potatoes until one doesn't burn, and in <span class="boldface">Hot Glass Looks Like Cold Glass</span>, where infrared goggles turn the scales.</p>
    <p>If a hot object is not to be touched, will it stay hot forever? It might well, if it is a steak on an electric grill, but not if it is a recently-baked apple pie sitting on a window-sill. <span class="boldface">Entropy</span> simulates the gradual return of temperature to equilibrium.</p>

            <p>We could just as easily adapt this rule to affect a container: &quot;Instead of taking something which is in the ice chest,&quot; for example.</p>
            <p>Note also that in older versions of Inform, the pattern &quot;get all from...&quot; was treated differently from &quot;get steak&quot;, and had to be accounted for separately. This is no longer the case; this instead of taking... rule will handle all the phrasings which the player might use to try to acquire this object.</p>
