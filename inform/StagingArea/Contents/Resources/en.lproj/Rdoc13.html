    <p class="sectionheading">§3.6. Windows</p>
    <p>Calvin Coolidge once described windows as &quot;rectangles of glass.&quot; For us, they have two purposes: first, they offer a view of landscape beyond. In the simplest case the view is of an area which will not be interacted with in play, and therefore does not need to adapt to whatever may have changed there:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c10246"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c10246"></a>The window is scenery in the Turret. &quot;Through the window you see miles and miles of unbroken forest, turning from green to flame in the hard early autumn.&quot;
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>More interesting is to adapt the view a little to provide a changing picture: a forest may not change much, but a street scene will. <span class="boldface">Port Royal 4</span> allows us to glimpse random passers-by.</p>
    <p>The trickiest kind of window allows the player to see another room which can also be encountered in play, and to interact with what is there. <span class="boldface">Dinner is Served</span> presents a shop window, allowing people to see inside from the street, and even to reach through.</p>
    <p><span class="boldface">Vitrine</span> handles the complication of a window misting up to become opaque, and thus temporarily hiding its view.</p>
    <p>Second, windows provide openings in walls and can act as conduits. <span class="boldface">Escape</span> shows how a &quot;door&quot; in the Inform sense can become a window. <span class="boldface">A Haughty Spirit</span> provides a general kind of window for jumping down out of: ideal for escapers from Colditz-like castles.</p>

            <p>Suppose we want to offer the player a window he can climb through, instead of a boring ordinary door.

            <p>Our protagonist is imprisoned in Port Royal, waiting out his years, and sometimes through the window of his cell he is able to see someone.</p>
            <p>We are, however, obsessive about historical accuracy, so we provide a table of people who really lived in the city, together with the year in which their existence is attested. We want these people to appear in the description only in the year when they are known to have been present. (After all, mortality was high in Port Royal and new people were constantly arriving, so someone's presence one year is no guarantee of their continued existence the next.)</p>

            <p>Suppose we have a game in which the player can climb through windows which overlook rooms below. We want him to be allowed to climb out windows to reach a room on the same level or at most one level lower than the one he's on; otherwise, he should get a refusal, saying that he would break his neck.</p>
            <p>To figure out the height distance between the start room and the destination room, we might have a repeat loop look at all the directions one has to follow along the &quot;best route&quot; path between the two rooms, and record any ups and downs; then subtract the number of &quot;up&quot; steps from the number of &quot;down&quot; steps, and report what remains.</p>
