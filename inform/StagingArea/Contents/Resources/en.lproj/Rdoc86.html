    <p class="sectionheading">§10.7. Electricity and Magnetism</p>
    <p>Electrons are so tiny, and move so fast, that we will never want to simulate them in ordinary IF. So we simply regard electricity and magnetism as behaviours which are either present or not present, and which have instantaneous effects.</p>
    <p>In <span class="boldface">Witnessed 1</span>, batteries provide electricity to enable a &quot;device&quot; to work. Even if switched on, a device with no battery will be ineffective.</p>
    <p>Larger voltages are exposed in <span class="boldface">Electrified</span>, which makes certain items untouchable, and ensures that an experienced electrician will not even try.</p>
    <p><span class="boldface">Rules of Attraction</span> provides for a magnet which attracts metallic items just strongly enough to stick together until pulled apart for any reason.</p>
