    <p class="sectionheading">§21.9. Accessing entries in a list</p>
    <p>The length of a list can change as values are added or removed, and can in principle be any number from 0 upwards. A list with 0 entries is empty. We can find the length with:</p>
        <!--START PHRASE "defn347"-->
        <div class="definition">
            <a id="defn347"></a><p class='defnprototype'><b>number of entries in</b>/of<b> </b>(list of values)<b> ... number</b></p>

            <!--END PHRASE-->
            <!--definition of ph_numberentries-->

    <p>    This phrase produces the number of positions in the list. Example:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c8436"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c8436"></a>the number of entries in {1, 1, 1, 3, 1}
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>is 5, even though there are only two genuinely different items in the list.</p>

        <!--end definition-->
    </div>

    <p>If the length is N then the entries are numbered from 1 (the front) to N (the back). These entries can be accessed directly by their numbers. For instance,</p>
    <!--START CODE "c8437"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c8437"></a>entry 2 of L
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>refers to the second entry of L: it can be used as a value, or changed, just as if it were a named variable. For instance, we could write:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c8438"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c8438"></a>now entry 7 of L is &quot;Spain&quot;;
    <br>
    say &quot;The rain in [entry 7 of L] stays mainly in the plain.&quot;;
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>which would (untruthfully) print &quot;The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain&quot;, but only if L had an entry 7 to make use of: if L were a list of 5 entries, say, then a run-time problem results. (And if L cannot hold text, a problem message means that we never get as far as run-time.) Because entries number from 1, this is always incorrect:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c8439"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c8439"></a>entry 0 of L
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>and if L is currently empty, then there is no entry which can be accessed, so that any use of &quot;entry ... of L&quot; would produce a run-time problem. There are programming languages in the world where accessing entry 100 in a 7-entry list automatically extends it to be 100 entries long: Inform is not one of them. But see the next section for how to change list lengths explicitly.</p>

            <p>We have seen how we can make a robot that watches the player, then plays back the same actions again. A slightly more adventurous implementation would be to let the player create a whole series of named scripts which the robot will run on command.</p>
            <p>To do this, we'll need each program to have a command that sets it off (stored as text, since this is the best way to capture and preserve arbitrary text entered by the player) and then the script of actions that must result:</p>

We'll give Robo a &quot;current program&quot; to store which program he's currently working on, and a number called &quot;stage&quot; which will record where he is in the script. Our previous implementation simply had Robo erase entries from his script list as he performed them, but this time we would like Robo to be able to remember and rerun the same scripts over and over, so we need something a little more subtle.</p>

            <p>...would store the script 'library theft' with the actions taking the book and going east. The implementation there would have been mostly identical, except that instead of an &quot;after doing something...&quot; rule, we would have captured commands as we asked Robo to perform them, and added those to the command list in progress. The alternative code might look something like this:</p>
