    <p class="sectionheading">§9.10. Telephones</p>
    <p>Telephones are much harder to achieve than televisions and in some ways as difficult to make convincing as a human character is - though of course there are corners which can be cut: we could have the reception drop off, or the other party hang up in a misunderstanding, and so on.</p>
    <p>A single telephone line is tricky enough to provide that one might just as well have a general solution providing a whole network. <span class="boldface">Four Cheeses</span> demonstrates a system where we can dial either people or numbers: CALL JANET ON TELEPHONE, or CALL 7103, for instance.</p>
    <p>While <span class="boldface">Four Cheeses</span> provides only four-digit phone numbers, like internal company extensions, <span class="boldface">Alias</span> shows how to manage US-style seven digit numbers.</p>
    <p>Finally, we might occasionally want the player to be able to address a microphone or telephone receiver directly when the identity of the person on the other end is unknown, in the form TELL MICROPHONE ABOUT CRIME. Ordinarily Inform will disallow this because we're not allowed to talk to inanimate objects, but the extension Inanimate Listeners provides more options.</p>

            <p>A note about this scope addition: the player can refer to the other party whenever they have the other person on the phone. They can't, however, see or refer to anything that person might be holding or wearing, thanks to the &quot;but not its contents&quot; option.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the player can't actually do anything to that person that requires touching. That's because of the reaching inside rules, which govern whether the player can reach through intervening barriers such as rooms. (See the Advanced Actions chapter for more about changing reachability.) There are two things we might want to be careful about, though.</p>
            <p>First, we should specifically disallow the player from looking at the person on the other end of the line. Since sight doesn't require touching, the reaching inside rules will not be consulted about a command such as EXAMINE BOSS or LOOK UNDER BOSS. We can, however, intervene in such cases using the visibility rules, which are consulted for any actions that &quot;require light&quot; (including EXAMINE and LOOK UNDER).
