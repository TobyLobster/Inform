    <p class="sectionheading">§6.15. All, each and every</p>
    <p>When testing conditions, we normally talk only about specific things, or else ask if a particular circumstance happens:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c1197"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c1197"></a>if the oaken door is open
    <br>
    if a woman is carrying an animal
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>But we can also use &quot;all&quot;, &quot;each&quot; or &quot;every&quot; to check the whole range:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c1198"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c1198"></a>if each door is open
    <br>
    if anyone is carrying all of the animals
    <br>
    if everybody is in the Dining Room
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Inform allows other English &quot;determiners&quot; (as they are sometimes called), as well:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c1199"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c1199"></a>if some of the doors are open
    <br>
    if most of the doors are open
    <br>
    if almost all of the doors are open
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>are true if at least one case is true, if a majority (any number greater than one half) or at least 80 per cent of the possible cases are true, respectively.</p>
    <p>And we can also use &quot;none&quot; and &quot;no&quot;. These three are all ways to say the same thing:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c1200"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c1200"></a>if no door is open
    <br>
    if all of the doors are not open
    <br>
    if none of the doors is open
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>though it may be clearer style to find a positive way of putting things:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c1201"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c1201"></a>if all of the doors are closed
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>All, each and every can be applied to values, too - but only in some cases. For example, suppose we write:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c1202"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c1202"></a>Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. A colour can be found or unfound.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>And suppose that, during play, we assign the &quot;found&quot; property to any colour which the player notices on a wall. We might then want to write conditions like so:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c1203"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c1203"></a>if every colour is found
    <br>
    if most of the colours are found
    <br>
    if any colour is found
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>But we always have to bear in mind that Inform might have no reasonable way to decide these questions. It will refuse to allow these, for example:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c1204"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c1204"></a>if every number is positive
    <br>
    if any text is palindromic
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>(even supposing the adjective &quot;palindromic&quot; has been defined) - there are practically infinitely many possible numbers and texts, so the search cannot sensibly be done.</p>

            <p>This example does include a number of features that we haven't met yet, particularly rulebooks. Nonetheless, the basic idea should be relatively clear. Our premise is that the player is faced with a series of disgruntled furnishings, none of which want to be responsible for supporting the cold, hot, drippy, or spiky objects lying around the room.</p>
