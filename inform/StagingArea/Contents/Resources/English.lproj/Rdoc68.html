<p>Inform provides an either/or property called &quot;edible&quot; and action, &quot;eating&quot;, for consuming edible things:</p>

The lardy cake is edible. After eating the lardy cake, say &quot;Sticky but delicious.&quot;

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>One of Inform's rules is that a person can only eat what he or she is holding - normally realistic, but it does prevent, say, eating a cherry off the tree. It's possible to override this: see <span class="boldface">Lollipop Guild</span>. <span class="boldface">Delicious, Delicious Rocks</span>, on the other hand, adds a sanity check which prevents the player from automatically taking inedible things only to be told they can't be eaten.</p>
<p>Inform does not normally simulate taste or digestion, but to provide foods with a range of flavours, see <span class="boldface">Would you...?</span>; to make eating different foods affect the player differently, see <span class="boldface">Stone</span>, or for the extreme case of poisoning foods, <span class="boldface">Candy</span>. In <span class="boldface">MRE</span>, hunger causes the player problems unless he regularly finds and eats food.</p>

<p>Many older interactive fiction games required the player to find food and eat on a regular basis in order to avoid death. This effect was often unrealistic (since most people can survive much longer than a few hours without eating) and is often seen as an annoyance. However, for the sake of argument, suppose that we do want to construct a hunger-and-death system.</p>
<p>To make things a little more interesting, we will postulate that different foods are differently filling, so that if the player manages to find something really caloric, he is off the hook on his hunger search for a while.</p>
<p>We will also implement the system so that the player gets messages when he is hungry, then dies a short time later. (The times involved are ludicrously short, but this allows us to see the effects within a simple example. In a real game we would want to allow a considerably longer timer for the hunger to play out.)</p>

<p>A thing can have a rule as a property, if we like. Here we are going to allow the player to make a soup whose effects will depend on its ingredients. Each ingredient will have its own &quot;food effect&quot; rule, to be followed when the food is eaten.</p>
<p>Note that there are other, slightly less cumbersome ways to do the same thing -- we will see in a few sections in the chapter on object-based rulebooks that we could make a &quot;food effects rulebook&quot; and then write a number of rules such as &quot;food effects rule for carrots&quot; or &quot;food effects rule for the stone&quot;. Nonetheless, we demonstrate rules-as-properties here for the sake of thoroughness.</p>

<p>...and in a small game with few rules, there's not much reason to add an extra stage. The ability to modify the stages of action processing becomes useful when we have a fairly large game with sophisticated modeling and want to be sure that some kinds of message (such as the sanity-check) are always handled before other things that we might be doing at the before stage (such as generating implicit actions like opening doors before going through them).</p>
